# Activity Summary for 05/12/2025

## 15:21:31
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/team-central/team.vue`.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/team-central/team.vue`**:

*   **Initial State (05/12/2025, 14:51:24 - 14:53:57):** The file consistently used a `<template v-for="n in 5">` structure within a skeleton loader for `LeaveHistory` without an explicit `:key` attribute on the `<template>` tag itself. The nested `<v-list-item>` elements, however, did have `:key="n"`.
*   **First Modification (05/12/2025, 14:57:15):** A notable change occurred where `:key="n"` was added to the `<template v-for="n in 5">` tag. This is a common practice in Vue to provide unique keys when using `v-for` on `<template>` elements, often to resolve linting warnings or improve component reconciliation.
    *   **From:** `<template v-for="n in 5">`
    *   **To:** `<template v-for="n in 5" :key="n">`
*   **Reversion (05/12/2025, 15:02:39):** This modification was short-lived, as the `:key="n"` attribute was removed from the `<template v-for="n in 5">` tag, reverting it to its original state.
*   **Subsequent States (05/12/2025, 15:02:55 - 15:18:38):** All subsequent entries for this file show the code in the reverted state, meaning the `<template v-for="n in 5">` element continued to lack the `:key` attribute.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **05/12/2025, 14:57:15:** Addition of `:key="n"` to `<template v-for>`.
*   **05/12/2025, 15:02:39:** Reversion (removal) of `:key="n"` from `<template v-for>`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The primary pattern observed is a brief attempt to update a `v-for` loop on a `<template>` element with a `:key` attribute, followed by a reversion of that change. The file contents remained largely identical across most entries, with only this specific key attribute being toggled.
