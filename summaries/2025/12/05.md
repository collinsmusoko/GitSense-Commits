# Activity Summary for 05/12/2025

## 15:21:31
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/team-central/team.vue`.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/team-central/team.vue`**:

*   **Initial State (05/12/2025, 14:51:24 - 14:53:57):** The file consistently used a `<template v-for="n in 5">` structure within a skeleton loader for `LeaveHistory` without an explicit `:key` attribute on the `<template>` tag itself. The nested `<v-list-item>` elements, however, did have `:key="n"`.
*   **First Modification (05/12/2025, 14:57:15):** A notable change occurred where `:key="n"` was added to the `<template v-for="n in 5">` tag. This is a common practice in Vue to provide unique keys when using `v-for` on `<template>` elements, often to resolve linting warnings or improve component reconciliation.
    *   **From:** `<template v-for="n in 5">`
    *   **To:** `<template v-for="n in 5" :key="n">`
*   **Reversion (05/12/2025, 15:02:39):** This modification was short-lived, as the `:key="n"` attribute was removed from the `<template v-for="n in 5">` tag, reverting it to its original state.
*   **Subsequent States (05/12/2025, 15:02:55 - 15:18:38):** All subsequent entries for this file show the code in the reverted state, meaning the `<template v-for="n in 5">` element continued to lack the `:key` attribute.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **05/12/2025, 14:57:15:** Addition of `:key="n"` to `<template v-for>`.
*   **05/12/2025, 15:02:39:** Reversion (removal) of `:key="n"` from `<template v-for>`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The primary pattern observed is a brief attempt to update a `v-for` loop on a `<template>` element with a `:key` attribute, followed by a reversion of that change. The file contents remained largely identical across most entries, with only this specific key attribute being toggled.

## 16:21:44
For the file `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/team-central/team.vue`, the log indicates a series of minor changes and reversions over approximately an hour, between 05/12/2025, 14:51:24 and 05/12/2025, 16:06:12.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The component `team.vue` functions as a dashboard for team-centric HRMS functionalities. It is structured with `v-row` and `v-col` for layout and dynamically renders various sections based on user access control (`getAccessControlForComponent`). The main content areas include:
*   An **Overview** section displaying `RequestsOverview`.
*   An **Upcoming Leave** section using `LeaveHistory`, which incorporates `v-skeleton-loader` for a smooth loading experience.
*   A **My Team** section featuring a `MembershipCard`.
*   **Projects/Tasks Stats** leveraging a `TaskStats` component.
*   An **Ongoing Tasks** panel displaying `TodayTasks`.
*   An **Ongoing Projects** section that lists projects with progress bars for task completion, displays assigned user avatars with tooltips, and uses an `Observer` component for infinite scrolling. It also includes a `ProjectSummary` dialog for details.
*   A **Time at Work** section integrating `FullCalendar` for attendance visualization. This section also features a `v-dialog` for downloading attendance reports, allowing filtering by department and employee, and selection of a date range via a `v-date-picker`.
*   A general `v-dialog` is also present for `TeamRequestInfo` (likely for leave request details).

The only identifiable code change in the provided logs occurred in the "Upcoming Leave" section's skeleton loader.
*   **05/12/2025, 14:57:15**: A `:key="n"` attribute was added to the `template v-for="n in 5"` loop within the `v-list` for skeleton items. This is a best practice in Vue.js for list rendering performance and state management.
*   **05/12/2025, 15:02:39**: This change was subsequently reverted, removing the `:key="n"` attribute from the `template v-for` loop.

All other entries in the log show identical code content to the initial state (or the state after the reversion).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **05/12/2025, 14:57:15**: Introduction of `:key="n"` attribute for template-based list rendering.
*   **05/12/2025, 15:02:39**: Reversion of the `:key="n"` attribute, indicating it was either a test or a change that was later deemed unnecessary or incorrect.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in Content:**
*   **Vuetify Framework Usage:** The component heavily relies on Vuetify's extensive set of UI components (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-dialog`, `v-select`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-progress-linear`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-avatar`, `v-tooltip`, `v-img`, `v-date-picker`, `v-text-field`) for its layout, styling, and interactive elements.
*   **Access Control:** A consistent pattern of `v-if="getAccessControlForComponent('ComponentName')"` is used throughout the template to conditionally render different UI blocks, ensuring role-based access to information.
*   **Internationalization:** All user-facing text is wrapped in `{{ $t(...) }}`, indicating the use of an internationalization library (e.g., Vue I18n) for multi-language support.
*   **Data Loading Indicators:** Skeleton loaders (`v-skeleton-loader`) are used to provide visual feedback during data fetching for "Upcoming Leave" sections. `v-progress-circular` is also used for the "Time at Work" section.
*   **Interactive Data Display:** Lists of projects and tasks are displayed with progress indicators and assigned user avatars, often including tooltips for additional information.
*   **Report Generation:** A dedicated dialog with filtering options (departments, employees, date range) and an Excel download functionality is a recurring pattern for report generation within the component.
