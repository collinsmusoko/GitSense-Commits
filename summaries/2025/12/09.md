The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/package.json` file was updated on **09/12/2025, 13:02:01**. This file outlines the project configuration, dependencies, and scripts for the `hrdirect` REST API MODEL-CONTROLLER-SERVICES application.

**Key updates and information from this file include:**

*   **Project Metadata:** The project is named `hrdirect`, version `1.0.0`, described as a "REST API MODEL-CONTROLLER-SERVICES". It's authored by "Support @ NATHAN DIGITAL" and licensed under "NathanDigital". The repository is hosted on Bitbucket.
*   **Node.js Environment:** The project specifies `node: "14.18.0"` and `npm: ">=6.14.15"` in `engines`, and `volta` also specifies `node: "14.18.3"`, indicating a preference for Node.js version 14.
*   **Scripts:** A comprehensive set of scripts is defined for various stages:
    *   **Deployment:** `start`, `staging`, `production` scripts use `pm2` with `ecosystem.config.json` for environment-specific deployments. A `shh` script is also available for stopping pm2.
    *   **Development:** `dev` uses `cross-env` and `nodemon`.
    *   **Testing:** `test`, `test:watch`, `coverage`, and `coverage:coveralls` use `jest` for unit and integration testing, including coverage reporting.
    *   **Code Quality:** `lint`, `lint:fix` (ESLint) and `prettier`, `prettier:fix` are configured for code style and formatting enforcement.
    *   **Docker:** `docker:prod`, `docker:dev`, `docker:test` scripts provide Docker Compose commands for different environments.
    *   **Hooks:** `prepare` uses `husky install` for Git hooks.
*   **Dependencies:** The project has an extensive list of dependencies, indicating a feature-rich application. Notable categories include:
    *   **NathanGroup specific packages:** A large number of internal packages are utilized, such as `@nathangroup/apm`, `@nathangroup/attendance`, `@nathangroup/claim`, `@nathangroup/leave`, `@nathangroup/letter`, `@nathangroup/payroll`, `@nathangroup/ssomatrix`, and `@nathangroup/wfh`, many of which also have associated email notification packages (e.g., `attendance-email`, `claim-email`). This highlights a strong integration with NathanGroup's internal ecosystem for HR-related functionalities.
    *   **Web Framework & Security:** `express`, `cors`, `helmet`, `compression`, `morgan`, `express-rate-limit`, `express-mongo-sanitize`, `xss-clean` for API development and security.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** `bcrypt`, `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, `jwt-decode`, `passport`, `passport-jwt`, `@azure/msal-node`, `google-auth-library`, `googleapis`, `firebase-admin`, `speakeasy` for robust authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Database:** `mongodb` and `mongoose` for database interactions.
    *   **Cloud Services:** `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `aws-sdk`, `multer-s3` for AWS S3 integration, and `@google-cloud/translate` for translation services.
    *   **File & Document Processing:** A significant number of packages for handling files, PDFs, and images including `express-fileupload`, `multer`, `pdf-creator-node`, `pdf-img-convert`, `pdf-lib`, `pdf-parse`, `pdf-poppler`, `pdf2image`, `pdfkit`, `pdfkit-table`, `pdfmake`, `sharp`, `exceljs`, `xlsx`, `csv-parser`, `json-2-csv`. This suggests heavy document generation and manipulation capabilities.
    *   **Emailing:** `@sendgrid/mail` and `nodemailer`.
    *   **Queueing & Background Jobs:** `bullmq`, `@bull-board/api`, `@bull-board/express`, `@bull-board/ui`, `ioredis`, `node-cron` for handling asynchronous tasks and job scheduling.
    *   **Utilities:** `axios`, `date-fns`, `moment`, `moment-timezone`, `dotenv`, `validator`, `crypto`, `dottie`, `socket.io` for various helper functions and real-time communication.
*   **Dev Dependencies:** Standard development tools like `eslint`, `prettier`, `jest`, `nodemon`, `supertest`, `husky`, `lint-staged` are included for testing, linting, and code formatting. `faker` is present for generating test data.
*   **Overrides:** `puppeteer` version is explicitly overridden to `^22.8.2`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HR-centric Functionality:** The repeated use of `@nathangroup` packages for attendance, claims, leave, payroll, WFH, and letters, along with their associated email modules, strongly indicates that the application is a core component of an HR Management System.
*   **Comprehensive Tooling:** The project employs a wide array of tools for every stage of development and deployment, from local development (nodemon, docker-compose dev) to production (pm2, docker-compose prod), testing (jest, supertest), and code quality (eslint, prettier, husky).
*   **Extensive Document Handling:** The numerous PDF and Excel-related packages highlight a critical need for generating, processing, and converting various documents within the system.
*   **Distributed System Design:** The inclusion of `bullmq`, `ioredis`, and `node-cron` points towards an architecture that handles background jobs and potentially scales asynchronous operations.
*   **Cloud Integration:** The use of AWS S3, Azure MSAL, and Google Cloud services suggests the application leverages external cloud platforms for various functionalities like storage, authentication, and translation.
