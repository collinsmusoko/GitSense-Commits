# Activity Summary for 11/12/2025

## 13:17:56
The changes primarily affect the `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-admin/pages/user/dashboard3/index.vue` file, which appears to be a main dashboard component, and also introduce or update the `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-admin/components/reuseable/attendance.vue` component.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-admin/pages/user/dashboard3/index.vue`**
This file, representing a dashboard for user `dashboard3`, underwent several sequential updates on **November 12, 2025**.

*   **12:27:40 to 12:28:45:** A minor UI adjustment was made to the attendance tooltip, changing its display position from `top` to `bottom`.
*   **12:28:45 to 12:33:18:** The `Attendance` component was temporarily removed from its dialog (`v-dialog`) within the attendance menu.
*   **12:33:18 to 12:34:02:** The entire attendance dialog (`v-dialog`) was removed from the menu, effectively preventing the `Attendance` component from being displayed.
*   **12:34:02 to 12:34:19:** The previous two changes were reverted. The attendance dialog was re-added, and the `Attendance` component was re-inserted into it. Additionally, a new "Social World" card (`id: #social`) was introduced to the `cards` data array, which are displayed in a `swiper` component. A previously commented-out "Rewards" card entry was also extended with an `icon2` property.

The dashboard integrates various features: weather display, user greetings, attendance clock-in/out functionality, a quote of the day, notification banners, a horizontal "spotlight" slider with dynamic cards (Date, Announcements, Rewards, Social World), a stock price ticker, and renders conditional components like `Events`, `MyDay`, `News`, `Rewards`, and `Socials` based on the selected card. It also uses skeleton loaders for initial loading states and a snackbar for user feedback.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-admin/components/reuseable/attendance.vue`**
This file received a significant update at **11/12/2025, 13:02:17**. This component manages and displays user attendance information.

*   **UI:** It features a `v-card` with a pie chart representing "Time at Work", displays "Clock In Time" and "Clock Out Time", along with "Clock In" and "Clock Out" buttons. A "Log History" button is also present.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   It tracks `startTime`, `endTime`, `in_latitude`, `in_longitude`, `break_startTime`, `break_endTime`, and `total` working hours.
    *   Includes methods for `checkIn`, `checkOut`, `breakin`, and `breakout` actions, along with `countDownTimer` for break tracking.
    *   Fetches today's attendance details (`getTodayAttendanceDetails`) and user information (`getUserInfo`) from a Vuex store.
    *   Attempts to retrieve the user's geolocation (`getLocation`, `showPosition`) and integrates with `openweather-apis` to display local weather.
    *   Uses a `chartjs-pie` component to visualize attendance data.
    *   Navigates to an attendance history page (`/dashboards/myhr#attendance`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue.js and Vuetify:** Both files extensively use Vue.js component structure and Vuetify UI components (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-btn`, `v-dialog`, `v-card`).
*   **Dashboard-like Structure:** The `index.vue` file clearly acts as a central dashboard, orchestrating various sub-components for a comprehensive user overview.
*   **Attendance Management:** A core theme across both files, with `index.vue` integrating a mini-attendance widget and a full attendance dialog, which in turn utilizes the `attendance.vue` component.
*   **Dynamic Data and UI:** Content is frequently rendered conditionally (`v-if`) or styled dynamically (`:class`, `:style`) based on component state, user data, and fetched information (e.g., weather, stock prices, attendance status).
*   **Date/Time Formatting:** A consistent pattern of using custom filters (`| time`, `| ampm`, `| day`, `| month`, `| secondsToHourMinuteTime`) for displaying date and time information.
*   **API Interaction:** Both components communicate with backend APIs using `$axios` for fetching and submitting data (e.g., attendance records).
*   **User Feedback:** Snackbars are used in both files to provide ephemeral messages to the user after actions.
*   **Modularity:** The dashboard breaks down complex features into smaller, reusable components (e.g., `Attendance`, `Events`, `News`, `Rewards`, `Socials`, `CreateTasks`).
