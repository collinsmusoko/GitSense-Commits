# Activity Summary for 04/12/2025

## 11:11:12
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/admin-central/index.vue` over a period of approximately 30 minutes on April 12, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates (`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/admin-central/index.vue`):**

*   **Template Section (UI Components):**
    *   **Initial State (10:36:07):** The page included `TeamCentral`, `EmploymentManagement`, `Requests`, `Support`, `Surveys`, `InsuranceDeletion`, and `AbsentEmployees` components, dynamically rendered based on a `selectedCard` value. A `swiper` component for navigation cards was also present. The `PerformanceCentral` component was imported but not utilized in the template.
    *   **Addition of PerformanceCentral (10:36:31):** The `PerformanceCentral` component was integrated into the template, becoming conditionally rendered for `selectedCard == '#performance-central'`.
    *   **Removal of EmploymentManagement (10:39:58):** The `EmploymentManagement` component's rendering block was removed from the template.
    *   **Removal of Swiper/Tabs UI (10:42:40):** The entire `<v-expand-transition>` block, which contained the `swiper` component for navigation cards and skeleton loaders, was removed, suggesting a temporary simplification or restructuring of the UI.
    *   **Re-addition of Swiper/Tabs UI and Removal of Main Content (10:44:46):** The `<v-expand-transition>` block with the `swiper` was re-added. Simultaneously, the main content `div` (containing all the conditionally rendered components like `TeamCentral`, `Requests`, etc.) was removed, making the page primarily display the company selection and the card-based navigation.
    *   **Re-addition of Main Content (10:45:34):** The main content `div` was restored, reverting the previous removal and bringing back the full layout.
    *   **Repeated Toggling of EmploymentManagement (10:47:34, 10:48:18):** `EmploymentManagement` was removed again at 10:47:34 and then immediately re-added at 10:48:18.
    *   **Removal of PerformanceCentral (10:49:34):** The `PerformanceCentral` component was removed from the template.
    *   **Removal of AbsentEmployees (10:50:00):** The `AbsentEmployees` component was removed from the template.
    *   **Re-addition of AbsentEmployees and PerformanceCentral (10:51:47):** Both `AbsentEmployees` and `PerformanceCentral` components were re-added to the template, reverting their prior removals.
    *   **Stripping Card Content and Removal of TeamCentral (10:55:23):** The internal content (`v-row` with image and text) of the navigation cards within the `swiper` was removed, leaving empty `v-card` elements. Concurrently, the `TeamCentral` component was removed from the main content area.
    *   **Restoration of Card Content and TeamCentral (10:56:09):** The content of the navigation cards was restored, and the `TeamCentral` component was re-added, reverting the previous changes.
    *   **Final Removal and Re-addition of TeamCentral (11:05:12, 11:06:29):** The `TeamCentral` component was removed once more at 11:05:12 and then re-added at 11:06:29.

*   **Script Section (Logic):**
    *   **Progressive `getData()` Method Expansion (10:39:58, 10:42:40, 10:44:46, 10:45:34, 10:47:34, 10:48:18, 10:49:34, 10:50:00, 10:51:47, 10:55:23, 10:56:09, 11:05:12, 11:06:29):** The `getData()` asynchronous method was incrementally extended across several commits. It initially fetched `accessibleCompanies`, then `roles` via an `/roles` API call, followed by `companyData` from `/companies/`. It also included logic for populating `companiesWithAll`, handling `selectedCompany` based on user data, and calling `toggleConfigByCompany()`. Later additions involved fetching and processing `coreconfig` data, specifically filtering for "Admin Central" module access. Many log entries show the method being truncated, implying continuous work on its implementation.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **04/12/2025, 10:36:07:** Baseline for the `admin-central/index.vue` page.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:36:31:** Introduction of the `PerformanceCentral` component to the UI.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:39:58:** First major expansion of `getData()` method logic, and removal of `EmploymentManagement` from template.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:42:40:** Temporary removal of the entire card-based navigation (swiper) UI section.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:44:46:** Re-introduction of the card-based navigation, with a temporary removal of the main content components.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:55:23:** Temporary removal of visible content within navigation cards and the `TeamCentral` component.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:56:09:** Restoration of navigation card content and `TeamCentral`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development:** All changes are concentrated on a single Vue file, indicating dedicated work on the `admin-central` page.
*   **Rapid Iteration/Debugging:** Components (`EmploymentManagement`, `PerformanceCentral`, `AbsentEmployees`, `TeamCentral`, and even the swiper navigation itself) are repeatedly added, removed, and re-added within very short timeframes (often within a minute). This suggests active testing, refactoring, or debugging of the UI and its conditional rendering logic.
*   **Progressive Logic Implementation:** The `getData()` method is consistently being extended with more data fetching and processing logic in smaller, sequential commits, rather than one large update. This is typical for feature development or API integration.
*   **Dynamic Module Management:** The overall goal appears to be managing different administrative modules (Team Central, Employment Management, Requests, etc.) through a selectable, card-based interface, with underlying logic for fetching company-specific configurations and user roles.

## 12:11:07
All recorded changes pertain to the file `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/admin-central/index.vue`, a Vue component responsible for an admin central dashboard.

**Timestamp-Specific Updates:**

*   **04/12/2025, 10:36:31:** The `PerformanceCentral` component was added to the template, becoming a conditionally rendered section of the dashboard.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:39:58:** The `EmploymentManagement` component was removed from the template's main content area.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:42:40:** This timestamp marks a substantial update.
    *   The entire `v-expand-transition` block, which contained the `swiper` component (used for displaying interactive cards and skeleton loaders), was removed from the template. This suggests a change in the primary navigation/selection UI for the dashboard.
    *   The `getData()` method in the script was significantly expanded. It now explicitly fetches `accessibleCompanies`, retrieves `roles` via an API call, and fetches `companyData` which is then processed and used to populate the `companiesWithAll` dropdown. New logic for filtering and sorting `companiesWithAll` was introduced, along with an initial `console.log` related to "Admin Module" access within a `coreconfig` fetch.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:44:46:** The `div` element wrapping the main conditional components (e.g., `TeamCentral`, `EmploymentManagement`) was removed. However, this change was immediately reverted at **10:45:34** where the `div` and its contents were re-introduced.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:47:34:** The `EmploymentManagement` component was removed again from the template. This was subsequently reverted at **10:48:18**.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:49:34:** The `PerformanceCentral` component was removed from the template. This was also reverted at **10:51:47**.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:55:23:** The internal structure for rendering content within each `v-card` inside the `swiper` component was removed, which would have made the cards appear empty. This was quickly reverted at **10:56:09**.
*   **04/12/2025, 11:05:12:** The `TeamCentral` component was removed from the template, only to be re-introduced at **11:06:29**.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI Component Fluctuation:** There's a consistent pattern of several major UI components (`EmploymentManagement`, `PerformanceCentral`, `TeamCentral`, and the interactive `swiper` card elements) being added, removed, or having their content altered in quick succession. This suggests an active and somewhat iterative process of designing, integrating, and possibly debugging the layout and functionality of the admin dashboard.
*   **`getData()` Method Evolution:** The `getData()` method undergoes continuous expansion, with new API calls for `roles`, `companyData`, and `coreconfig` being integrated. However, the log entries frequently show this method as truncated, indicating either partial saves or that only the modified portions of the code were captured. The placement of `await this.fetchAccessibleCompanies();` at the start of `getData()` after 10:42:40 indicates a dependency for subsequent data fetches.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The primary content area relies heavily on `v-if="selectedCard == '#componentName'"` to dynamically display different administrative sections, controlled by the `selectedCard` data property.
*   **Company Selection Logic:** A `v-select` component for choosing a company is present throughout, interacting with `toggleConfigByCompany()` and influencing data displayed across the different admin modules.
