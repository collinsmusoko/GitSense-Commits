# Activity Summary for 04/12/2025

## 11:11:12
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/admin-central/index.vue` over a period of approximately 30 minutes on April 12, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates (`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/admin-central/index.vue`):**

*   **Template Section (UI Components):**
    *   **Initial State (10:36:07):** The page included `TeamCentral`, `EmploymentManagement`, `Requests`, `Support`, `Surveys`, `InsuranceDeletion`, and `AbsentEmployees` components, dynamically rendered based on a `selectedCard` value. A `swiper` component for navigation cards was also present. The `PerformanceCentral` component was imported but not utilized in the template.
    *   **Addition of PerformanceCentral (10:36:31):** The `PerformanceCentral` component was integrated into the template, becoming conditionally rendered for `selectedCard == '#performance-central'`.
    *   **Removal of EmploymentManagement (10:39:58):** The `EmploymentManagement` component's rendering block was removed from the template.
    *   **Removal of Swiper/Tabs UI (10:42:40):** The entire `<v-expand-transition>` block, which contained the `swiper` component for navigation cards and skeleton loaders, was removed, suggesting a temporary simplification or restructuring of the UI.
    *   **Re-addition of Swiper/Tabs UI and Removal of Main Content (10:44:46):** The `<v-expand-transition>` block with the `swiper` was re-added. Simultaneously, the main content `div` (containing all the conditionally rendered components like `TeamCentral`, `Requests`, etc.) was removed, making the page primarily display the company selection and the card-based navigation.
    *   **Re-addition of Main Content (10:45:34):** The main content `div` was restored, reverting the previous removal and bringing back the full layout.
    *   **Repeated Toggling of EmploymentManagement (10:47:34, 10:48:18):** `EmploymentManagement` was removed again at 10:47:34 and then immediately re-added at 10:48:18.
    *   **Removal of PerformanceCentral (10:49:34):** The `PerformanceCentral` component was removed from the template.
    *   **Removal of AbsentEmployees (10:50:00):** The `AbsentEmployees` component was removed from the template.
    *   **Re-addition of AbsentEmployees and PerformanceCentral (10:51:47):** Both `AbsentEmployees` and `PerformanceCentral` components were re-added to the template, reverting their prior removals.
    *   **Stripping Card Content and Removal of TeamCentral (10:55:23):** The internal content (`v-row` with image and text) of the navigation cards within the `swiper` was removed, leaving empty `v-card` elements. Concurrently, the `TeamCentral` component was removed from the main content area.
    *   **Restoration of Card Content and TeamCentral (10:56:09):** The content of the navigation cards was restored, and the `TeamCentral` component was re-added, reverting the previous changes.
    *   **Final Removal and Re-addition of TeamCentral (11:05:12, 11:06:29):** The `TeamCentral` component was removed once more at 11:05:12 and then re-added at 11:06:29.

*   **Script Section (Logic):**
    *   **Progressive `getData()` Method Expansion (10:39:58, 10:42:40, 10:44:46, 10:45:34, 10:47:34, 10:48:18, 10:49:34, 10:50:00, 10:51:47, 10:55:23, 10:56:09, 11:05:12, 11:06:29):** The `getData()` asynchronous method was incrementally extended across several commits. It initially fetched `accessibleCompanies`, then `roles` via an `/roles` API call, followed by `companyData` from `/companies/`. It also included logic for populating `companiesWithAll`, handling `selectedCompany` based on user data, and calling `toggleConfigByCompany()`. Later additions involved fetching and processing `coreconfig` data, specifically filtering for "Admin Central" module access. Many log entries show the method being truncated, implying continuous work on its implementation.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **04/12/2025, 10:36:07:** Baseline for the `admin-central/index.vue` page.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:36:31:** Introduction of the `PerformanceCentral` component to the UI.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:39:58:** First major expansion of `getData()` method logic, and removal of `EmploymentManagement` from template.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:42:40:** Temporary removal of the entire card-based navigation (swiper) UI section.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:44:46:** Re-introduction of the card-based navigation, with a temporary removal of the main content components.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:55:23:** Temporary removal of visible content within navigation cards and the `TeamCentral` component.
*   **04/12/2025, 10:56:09:** Restoration of navigation card content and `TeamCentral`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development:** All changes are concentrated on a single Vue file, indicating dedicated work on the `admin-central` page.
*   **Rapid Iteration/Debugging:** Components (`EmploymentManagement`, `PerformanceCentral`, `AbsentEmployees`, `TeamCentral`, and even the swiper navigation itself) are repeatedly added, removed, and re-added within very short timeframes (often within a minute). This suggests active testing, refactoring, or debugging of the UI and its conditional rendering logic.
*   **Progressive Logic Implementation:** The `getData()` method is consistently being extended with more data fetching and processing logic in smaller, sequential commits, rather than one large update. This is typical for feature development or API integration.
*   **Dynamic Module Management:** The overall goal appears to be managing different administrative modules (Team Central, Employment Management, Requests, etc.) through a selectable, card-based interface, with underlying logic for fetching company-specific configurations and user roles.
