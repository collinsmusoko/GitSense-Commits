# Activity Summary for 02/12/2025

## 09:29:10
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`, across two timestamps on `02/12/2025`.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp `02/12/2025, 08:49:49`**: This version of the `Bell.vue` component, which manages user notifications, had an empty `v-tooltip` activator template, meaning the notification bell icon itself was not yet visually defined within the template.
    *   **Timestamp `02/12/2025, 08:51:27`**: A significant UI update was implemented for the notification bell. The `v-tooltip` activator template was populated with a `v-btn` element.
        *   This `v-btn` now encapsulates a `v-badge` component.
        *   The `v-badge` dynamically displays the `refreshedCount` (number of unread notifications) and changes its color to 'red' if `refreshedCount` is greater than zero, providing a visual indicator for new notifications.
        *   Inside the `v-badge`, a `v-img` element was added to display the actual notification icon, loaded from `/header/notification-bing.svg`.
        *   Event listeners for both the menu and tooltip (`on` and `onTooltip`) were combined and applied to the `v-btn`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The changes occurred in close succession:
*   `02/12/2025, 08:49:49`: Initial state or near-final state before the icon implementation.
*   `02/12/2025, 08:51:27`: The visual implementation of the notification bell icon and its unread count badge was added.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Notification Management**: The component's primary function is to handle, display, and manage user notifications, including marking them as read, fetching new notifications with infinite scroll, and routing to notification details.
*   **Vue.js Component Structure**: The code follows a standard Vue.js component structure with `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style scoped>` sections.
*   **Vuetify Usage**: It heavily utilizes Vuetify components (`v-menu`, `v-tooltip`, `v-btn`, `v-badge`, `v-img`, `v-card`, `v-list`, `v-list-item`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-chip`, `v-divider`) for its UI.
*   **Dynamic UI Elements**: Several parts of the UI are dynamic, such as the notification list, the "Mark as Read" button visibility, and the notification count badge.
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**: The use of `$t()` indicates that the component supports multiple languages for UI texts like "dashboard.dashboard_notification" and "NEW".
*   **API Interaction**: The component interacts with a backend API to fetch and update notifications (`this.$axios.$get`, `this.$axios.$put`) using a bearer token for authorization.
*   **Real-time Updates**: The use of `this.$nuxt.$on("newNotification", this.getNotifications)` suggests a mechanism for real-time updates when new notifications arrive.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: API calls are handled asynchronously using `async`/`await` and include error handling (though the `catch` blocks are empty).
*   **Data Fetching and Pagination**: Notifications are fetched with skip and limit parameters, implementing infinite scrolling logic via the `onScroll` method.
