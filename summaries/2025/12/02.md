# Activity Summary for 02/12/2025

## 09:29:10
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`, across two timestamps on `02/12/2025`.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp `02/12/2025, 08:49:49`**: This version of the `Bell.vue` component, which manages user notifications, had an empty `v-tooltip` activator template, meaning the notification bell icon itself was not yet visually defined within the template.
    *   **Timestamp `02/12/2025, 08:51:27`**: A significant UI update was implemented for the notification bell. The `v-tooltip` activator template was populated with a `v-btn` element.
        *   This `v-btn` now encapsulates a `v-badge` component.
        *   The `v-badge` dynamically displays the `refreshedCount` (number of unread notifications) and changes its color to 'red' if `refreshedCount` is greater than zero, providing a visual indicator for new notifications.
        *   Inside the `v-badge`, a `v-img` element was added to display the actual notification icon, loaded from `/header/notification-bing.svg`.
        *   Event listeners for both the menu and tooltip (`on` and `onTooltip`) were combined and applied to the `v-btn`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The changes occurred in close succession:
*   `02/12/2025, 08:49:49`: Initial state or near-final state before the icon implementation.
*   `02/12/2025, 08:51:27`: The visual implementation of the notification bell icon and its unread count badge was added.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Notification Management**: The component's primary function is to handle, display, and manage user notifications, including marking them as read, fetching new notifications with infinite scroll, and routing to notification details.
*   **Vue.js Component Structure**: The code follows a standard Vue.js component structure with `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style scoped>` sections.
*   **Vuetify Usage**: It heavily utilizes Vuetify components (`v-menu`, `v-tooltip`, `v-btn`, `v-badge`, `v-img`, `v-card`, `v-list`, `v-list-item`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-chip`, `v-divider`) for its UI.
*   **Dynamic UI Elements**: Several parts of the UI are dynamic, such as the notification list, the "Mark as Read" button visibility, and the notification count badge.
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**: The use of `$t()` indicates that the component supports multiple languages for UI texts like "dashboard.dashboard_notification" and "NEW".
*   **API Interaction**: The component interacts with a backend API to fetch and update notifications (`this.$axios.$get`, `this.$axios.$put`) using a bearer token for authorization.
*   **Real-time Updates**: The use of `this.$nuxt.$on("newNotification", this.getNotifications)` suggests a mechanism for real-time updates when new notifications arrive.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: API calls are handled asynchronously using `async`/`await` and include error handling (though the `catch` blocks are empty).
*   **Data Fetching and Pagination**: Notifications are fetched with skip and limit parameters, implementing infinite scrolling logic via the `onScroll` method.

## 10:29:15
The provided log details a series of changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`. This component is responsible for displaying user notifications within the application.

**File-Specific Updates for `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`:**

*   **02/12/2025, 08:51:27:**
    *   **Template Update:** The notification bell's visual representation was enhanced. A `v-btn` containing a `v-badge` was added to the `v-tooltip` activator. This badge dynamically displays the `refreshedCount` (number of unread notifications) and changes color to red if there are new notifications. A `v-img` element with `src="/header/notification-bing.svg"` was introduced to provide the notification icon.
*   **02/12/2025, 09:59:35:**
    *   **Script Update (openUrl method):** The `openUrl` method, which handles navigation when a notification is clicked, was significantly expanded. New `else if` conditions were added to:
        *   Specifically handle "Request notification" types or notifications whose `notification_type` includes "Request," routing them to `/requests` or a specific `data.url` with `request_id` or `docId` as a query parameter.
        *   Handle general notifications that include a `docId`, routing them to `data.url` with the `id` as a query parameter.
*   **02/12/2025, 10:24:40:**
    *   **Script Update (openUrl method):** The `openUrl` method was further refined to include a `highlight` query parameter in the routing logic for various notification types:
        *   "Social notification" now includes `highlight: data.docId`.
        *   "Request notification" now includes `highlight: data.docId || data.requestId`.
        *   General `docId` notifications now include `highlight: data.docId`. This suggests an intent to visually highlight the relevant item on the destination page.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Focus on Notifications:** All changes are centered around enhancing the user experience for notifications, ranging from visual indicators to sophisticated routing based on notification content.
*   **Incremental Feature Development:** The changes demonstrate a step-by-step approach to adding and improving functionality: first adding a visual badge, then making routing smarter, and finally adding specific UI hints for navigation.
*   **Dynamic Routing based on Notification Type:** The `openUrl` method consistently uses notification properties like `data.type`, `data.docId`, and `data.url` to determine the appropriate navigation path and parameters, allowing for specialized handling of different notification categories (e.g., social, requests).
*   **Vuetify Component Usage:** The component extensively uses Vuetify components (`v-menu`, `v-tooltip`, `v-btn`, `v-badge`, `v-card`, `v-list`, etc.) for its UI, indicating a standardized design framework.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** The use of `$t()` for text content (e.g., `$t("dashboard.dashboard_notification")`) is prevalent, confirming support for multiple languages.
*   **API Interactions and Authentication:** The component relies on API calls (`this.$axios.$get`, `this.$axios.$put`) for fetching and updating notification status, using a Bearer token for authorization.
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** The presence of `onScroll` and `pageLimit` indicates that the notification list supports infinite scrolling to load more content efficiently.

## 11:29:26
The changes primarily focus on enhancing and refining the notification system within the `ccl-hrms-admin` application, affecting two main files: `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/notifications/index.vue`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`**
    *   **02/12/2025, 08:49:49 (Initial State):** This component, `Bell.vue`, provides a dropdown notification menu. It fetches user-specific notifications with pagination and infinite scroll, allows marking notifications as read individually or in bulk, and routes to specific URLs based on notification type (`openUrl` method). It uses `moment.js` for date formatting and `NoDataFound` component for empty states.
    *   **02/12/2025, 08:51:27:** A significant UI update was introduced. The notification activator in the header, previously an empty slot, was enhanced to display a `v-btn` containing a `v-badge`. This badge dynamically shows the `refreshedCount` (number of unread notifications) with a red background if there are unread notifications, alongside a `v-img` element showing a "notification-bing.svg" icon. This makes the unread notification count visible in the application header.
    *   **02/12/2025, 09:59:35:** The `openUrl` method was expanded to include more specific routing logic. It introduced dedicated handling for "Request notification" types (routing to `/requests` with `request_id` or `docId` query parameters) and a general case for notifications with a `docId` (routing to `data.url` with an `id` query parameter). Previously, it only distinguished between "Social notification" and other general URLs.
    *   **02/12/2025, 10:24:40:** Further refinements to the `openUrl` method added a `highlight` query parameter to all specific routing scenarios (Social, Request, and general `docId` routes). This suggests an intent to visually highlight the target item on the destination page upon navigation from a notification.
    *   **02/12/2025, 10:37:58 to 02/12/2025, 10:38:47:** Multiple subsequent timestamps for this file show no functional code changes, indicating repeated saves without alterations.
    *   **02/12/2025, 11:18:18 (Reversion):** The advanced routing logic introduced in the `openUrl` method (for "Request notification" and `docId` with `highlight` parameter) was reverted. The `openUrl` method returned to its simpler state, only distinguishing between "Social notification" and other direct `data.url` pushes, effectively removing the `highlight` parameter functionality from this component.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/notifications/index.vue`**
    *   **02/12/2025, 10:38:54 (Initial Introduction):** This new page component was introduced to display all user notifications, categorized into "Today", "This Week", and "Older" sections. It includes features for infinite loading of notifications (`getUserInfo` method calls itself recursively), displays unread counts, and uses `moment.js` for date categorization. Crucially, it introduced a `checkHighlight` method to read a `highlight` query parameter from the URL, `highlightedId` data property, and `scrollToNotification` to smoothly scroll to and temporarily highlight a specific notification row (`.highlighted-notification`) on the page. The `openURL` method also supports passing a `highlight` query parameter when navigating.
    *   **02/12/2025, 10:39:04:** CSS styling was added to visually support the notification highlighting feature. The `.notification-row` received a transition, and `.highlighted-notification` was defined with a yellow background, a yellow border, and a "pulse" animation, ensuring that highlighted notifications are visually distinct.
    *   **02/12/2025, 11:00:29 to 02/12/2025, 11:01:40:** Multiple subsequent timestamps for this file show no functional code changes, indicating repeated saves without alterations.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **02/12/2025, 08:51:27:** Introduction of the visual notification badge and icon in `Bell.vue`.
*   **02/12/2025, 09:59:35:** Expansion of notification routing logic in `Bell.vue` to handle more types.
*   **02/12/2025, 10:24:40:** Addition of a `highlight` query parameter to notification routing in `Bell.vue`.
*   **02/12/2025, 10:38:54:** Introduction of the `/pages/notifications/index.vue` page, complete with notification categorization, infinite scroll, and a robust highlighting/scrolling mechanism.
*   **02/12/2025, 10:39:04:** Addition of CSS for visual highlighting of notifications in `notifications/index.vue`.
*   **02/12/2025, 11:18:18:** Reversion of advanced routing and `highlight` parameter logic in `Bell.vue`.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Notification System Development:** The central theme is the development and refinement of a user notification system, encompassing display, management, and navigation.
*   **Vue.js and Vuetify:** All changes are within Vue.js components, leveraging Vuetify components (`v-menu`, `v-card`, `v-list`, `v-btn`, `v-badge`, `v-tooltip`, `v-avatar`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-snackbar`) for UI elements.
*   **API Interaction:** Both components consistently interact with a backend `/notifications/user/:userId` endpoint for data retrieval, using bearer token authentication.
*   **Internationalization (`$t`):** Extensive use of the `$t` function indicates support for multiple languages across UI text and even dynamic notification content.
*   **Date/Time Handling:** `moment.js` is consistently used for formatting and categorizing dates (e.g., "Today", "This Week", "Older").
*   **Highlighting Feature (Iterative Development):** A clear pattern emerges where a feature to "highlight" a specific notification by passing a `highlight` query parameter was introduced across both `Bell.vue` (for outbound links) and `notifications/index.vue` (for inbound processing and display), including dedicated CSS. However, the outgoing `highlight` parameter logic in `Bell.vue` was later reverted, suggesting an iterative development process, perhaps a temporary experimental feature or a change in requirements for that specific component. The `notifications/index.vue` page retains the ability to process and display the highlight.
*   **Pagination/Infinite Scrolling:** Both components exhibit logic for fetching notifications in chunks (`pageLimit`, `skipCount`), with `Bell.vue` implementing it via scroll event and `notifications/index.vue` via recursive `getUserInfo` calls.

## 12:51:21
The code changes primarily focus on two Vue.js components within the `sata-admin` project: `requests.vue` (for administrative request management) and `leave.vue` (for HR self-service leave management).

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue**
    *   **Timestamp: 02/12/2025, 12:18:55**: This entry provides the initial structure of the `requests.vue` component. It's designed to manage various request types in an admin-central context. The component includes sections for creating new requests (e.g., Leave, Air Ticket, Loan, WFH, Claims, Attendance, Letters, Grade/Designation Change, Bank Details, Passport Safekeep/Release, Salary Advance/Adjustment) and viewing a history of existing requests. It utilizes Vue.js components for each specific request type, dynamic rendering based on `requestType`, a search bar, and infinite scrolling (`Observer` component).
    *   **Timestamp: 02/12/2025, 12:26:27**: A significant update occurred here. The `v-for` loop responsible for rendering the list of `visibleData` items in the request history section was modified to incorporate a new `RequestListing` component. Previously, the loop was empty, implying that the rendering logic was either missing or handled elsewhere. The addition of `<RequestListing :data="data" :users="users" :user="user" :emailBody="emailBody" :computedServiceList="computedServiceList" @getTeamRequestPreview="getTeamRequestPreview($event)" :viewRequestHistory="viewRequestHistory" />` standardizes and encapsulates the display of individual request items.
    *   **Subsequent Timestamps (12:31:20, 12:32:15, 12:33:21, 12:34:40, 12:35:18, 12:36:09, 12:37:18, 12:38:45, 12:40:06, 12:43:54)**: The content of `requests.vue` remains identical across these entries. This suggests multiple saves or minor, non-functional changes (like whitespace) that are not reflected in the provided code snippets. The functionality introduced at 12:26:27 appears stable across these later timestamps.

*   **/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/hr-self-service/leave.vue**
    *   **Timestamp: 02/12/2025, 12:42:24**: This entry details the `leave.vue` component, which handles self-service leave requests and team leave calendars. It features:
        *   A form for "New Leave Request" using the `CreateLeaves` component.
        *   A "Leave History" section (`LeaveHistory` component).
        *   A togglable view for a "Team Calendar" or individual "Leave" details.
        *   The team calendar (`v-calendar`) displays leave events with different colors based on status and allows navigation by month, week, or day.
        *   It manages various leave-related data properties such as `leavesD`, `events`, `selectedEvent`, and form data for `leave` requests.
        *   Methods are included for fetching leave lists (`getTeamLeaveList`), resetting forms (`resetLeaveFormFn`), and calendar interactions.
        *   Lifecycle hooks (`created`, `mounted`) are used to initialize data and listen for events.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Both `requests.vue` and `leave.vue` extensively use child components (e.g., `CreateLeaves`, `AnnualAirTicket`, `LetterRequest`, `RequestListing`, `LeaveHistory`, `LeaveInfo`) to modularize functionality, which is a common Vue.js pattern.
*   **Internationalization (`$t`):** Both components consistently use `$t(...)` for text, indicating support for multiple languages and translation.
*   **Styling with Vuetify:** The use of `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-select`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-date-picker`, `v-img`, `v-tooltip`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-list`, `v-list-item-group`, `v-calendar`, `v-menu`, `v-sheet`, and `v-toolbar` points to the extensive use of the Vuetify UI framework for component styling and layout.
*   **Request/Leave Management Focus:** Both files are central to managing different types of requests and leaves within the application, suggesting a core HR or administrative function.
*   **Admin and Self-Service Contexts:** The file paths indicate a clear separation between `admin-central` components (like `requests.vue`) and `hr-self-service` components (like `leave.vue`), implying distinct user roles and workflows.
*   **Data Fetching:** The `leave.vue` component explicitly shows patterns of making API calls (`this.$axios.$get`, `this.$axios.$post`) with authentication headers (`Bearer Token`) to fetch data, indicating client-server communication.
*   **User/Employee Context:** Components frequently pass `user`, `selectedEmp`, `users`, and `configData` as props, highlighting the importance of user-specific data and configuration.

## 13:51:22
The log shows code changes across several Vue components related to an HR request management system, along with an environment file.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-api/.env`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `02/12/2025, 12:09:12`
    *   This file, containing environment variables, was modified. As per instructions, its specific content is not summarized due to the presence of sensitive keys and credentials (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY_AWS`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GPT_API_KEY`).

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps:** `02/12/2025, 12:18:55` through `02/12/2025, 13:06:20` (multiple changes over a period).
    *   This Vue component manages administrative requests.
    *   **Key Update:** An important change occurred at `02/12/2025, 12:26:27`, where the component began utilizing a new reusable `RequestListing` component to display individual request items when not viewing support tickets. Prior to this, the request listing logic was likely embedded directly.
    *   The component supports creating various request types (Leaves, Air Ticket, Time Off Lieu, Loan, WFH, Salary Advance, Claims, Attendance, Salary Adjustment, Trip Request, Letter Request, Grade Change, Designation Change, Bank Details, Passport Safekeep/Release) using dynamically rendered sub-components.
    *   It includes functionality for selecting an employee, a date picker for attendance, search, and a view for support tickets with status filtering.
    *   Numerous, small changes were recorded between `12:31:20` and `12:40:06`, and again at `13:06:20`, suggesting minor adjustments or saves without significant structural code differences visible in the provided snippets for those specific timestamps.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/hr-self-service/leave.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `02/12/2025, 12:42:24`
    *   This Vue component handles self-service leave requests for employees.
    *   It features conditional rendering for creating new leave requests (using `CreateLeaves`) and viewing leave history (using `LeaveHistory`).
    *   A "Team Calendar" feature is integrated, allowing visualization of leave events with calendar navigation.
    *   The component defines methods for resetting forms, managing snackbar notifications, and fetching team leave lists, with logic to differentiate between office reception users and departmental users for data retrieval.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/reuseable/requestListing.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps:** `02/12/2025, 13:03:48` through `02/12/2025, 13:04:13` (multiple changes in close succession).
    *   This is a new reusable Vue component designed to display a single request item within a list.
    *   It dynamically renders icons (ClaimsSVG, WfhSVG, LettersSVG, LeavesSVG, AttendanceSVG) based on the request type and status, applies status-based border styling, and formats request details (e.g., leave type, claim sub-type, loan amount, dates).
    *   It supports internationalization (`$t`) for request types and includes a tooltip for signed letter versions.
    *   The multiple timestamps indicate minor, iterative adjustments to this new component.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/requests.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `02/12/2025, 13:10:51`
    *   This Vue component functions similarly to `admin-central/requests.vue` but is tailored for "Team Central," specifically setting `userType="MANAGER"` for many request creation sub-components.
    *   It also uses the `RequestListing` component and passes an `existingTranslationKeys` prop to it.
    *   Notably, the support ticket section in this component uses different internationalization keys for status options compared to the `admin-central` counterpart, indicating different language/terminology requirements for a manager's view.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component Reusability:** A strong pattern is the refactoring of common UI elements into reusable components, particularly evident with `RequestListing.vue` being introduced and then used in both `admin-central/requests.vue` and `team-central/requests.vue`.
*   **HR Request Workflow:** All `.vue` files are interconnected parts of an HR request system, covering various types of employee requests (leave, claims, loans, letters, attendance adjustments, etc.) and their management from different perspectives (admin, self-service, team/manager).
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** The widespread use of `$t()` and `$te()` for text elements demonstrates a commitment to multi-language support across the application.
*   **Conditional UI Rendering:** Heavy reliance on `v-if` and `v-else-if` to dynamically display forms or lists based on user actions, selected filters, and data properties.
*   **Frequent Commits/Saves:** The very close timestamps for multiple changes within the same file suggest a continuous development process with frequent saves or minor adjustments being logged.
*   **Vuetify Framework:** The code snippets consistently use Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-select`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-list`, `v-img`, `v-chip`, `v-tooltip`, `v-icon`, `v-btn`, `v-snackbar`, `v-calendar`, `v-menu`), indicating a standardized UI framework.
*   **Dynamic SVG Icons:** The `RequestListing.vue` component dynamically loads different SVG icons (ClaimsSVG, WfhSVG, LettersSVG, LeavesSVG, AttendanceSVG) based on the request type, enhancing visual representation.
