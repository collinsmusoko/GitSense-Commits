The filename implies it's related to fixing email templates.

The file `/Users/collin/projects/ngex/ngex-api/src/emails/leave.email.js` saw activity at `03/12/2025, 11:09:56` and again at `03/12/2025, 11:10:33`. The code content provided for both timestamps is identical, indicating that no functional changes were introduced between these two logged events for this file. This file is a JavaScript module responsible for generating parameter objects for various leave-related email templates.

Key aspects of `leave.email.js`:
*   **Dependencies:** It utilizes `moment` for date formatting and `lodash` for utility functions (though `lodash` is imported, its functions are not directly visible in the provided code snippets). It imports helper functions `getApprovers`, `getUserName`, and `getUserTitle` from `../helper/email_helper`.
*   **Purpose:** It exports a collection of functions (`getNewLeaveRequestParams`, `getLeaveWithdrawParams`, `getLeaveRequestApproverParams`, `getLeaveApprovedParams`, `getLeaveRejectedParams`, `getLeaveApprovedAdminParams`, `getLeaveRejectedAdminParams`, `getAirTicketHRParams`) that standardize the data structure required for different email types related to leave requests and air ticket requests for HR.
*   **Content Generation Pattern:** All functions construct an object containing common email parameters. These include:
    *   **Employee Information:** `employeeTitle`, `employeeName`, `employeeFirstName`, `employeeLastName` (derived from `obj_userInfo` using helper functions).
    *   **Request Details:** `requestType` (leave_type), `requestStartDate`, `requestEndDate`, `requestNoOfDays`, `requestCreatedDate`. Dates are consistently formatted using `moment().format('D MMMM YYYY')`.
    *   **Company Information:** `websiteUrl`, `companyName`, `companyAddress`, `companyPhone`, `companyLogo`/`companyLogoLink` (sourced from `obj_companyInfo`).
    *   **Approver Information:** `approversFullName` or `approverName` are often included, utilizing the `getApprovers` helper. `approverComments` and `processDate` are present for approved/rejected leave emails.
    *   **Specific Details:** The `getAirTicketHRParams` function includes additional fields for air ticket requests such as `requestReason`, `departureCountry`, `departureAirport`, `arrivalCountry`, `arrivalAirport`, and `travelDate`, using optional chaining (`?.`) for nested properties.
*   **Consistency:** There is a strong pattern of extracting employee, company, and request details to populate email parameters, ensuring a consistent structure for various notification types within the system.

A file `/Users/collin/projects/ngex/fix-email-templates.js` was initially empty or cleared at `03/12/2025, 10:09:08`. It was later updated at `03/12/2025, 11:29:17` with a Node.js script. This script is designed to connect to a MongoDB database (using environment configurations) and fix URLs within existing leave request email templates stored in the `EmailConfig` collection. The script identifies specific leave-related templates and systematically replaces various incorrect or hardcoded URLs (such as `admin-central#requests`, `localhost`, staging, and production domains) with dynamic `[websiteUrl]` placeholders and role-specific dashboard paths (e.g., `/dashboards/myhr#leave` for employees, `/dashboards/my-team#requests` for approvers). It logs the changes and provides instructions for testing.

The file `/Users/collin/projects/ngex/ngex-api/src/emails/leave.email.js` was updated twice in quick succession at `03/12/2025, 11:09:56` and `03/12/2025, 11:10:33`. Both updates contain identical code. This file exports a module with several functions (e.g., `getNewLeaveRequestParams`, `getLeaveWithdrawParams`, `getLeaveApprovedParams`, `getAirTicketHRParams`). These functions are responsible for generating structured parameter objects used to populate various leave and air-ticket related email templates. They utilize `moment` for consistent date formatting (`D MMMM YYYY`) and helper functions (`getApprovers`, `getUserName`, `getUserTitle`) to extract and format user and company-specific details for the emails.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Email Parameter Generation:** The `leave.email.js` consistently defines functions to construct parameter objects for different email types, including common fields like employee name, request type, dates, company information, and `websiteUrl`.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `moment` library is extensively used in `leave.email.js` to format dates into the `D MMMM YYYY` string format across all email parameter generation functions.
*   **URL Standardization:** The `fix-email-templates.js` script shows a clear pattern of replacing hardcoded or incorrect URLs with a `[websiteUrl]` placeholder, ensuring flexibility and environment independence for email links.
*   **Role-Specific Navigation:** Both the `leave.email.js` (by including `websiteUrl`) and `fix-email-templates.js` (by correcting `href` attributes) demonstrate a focus on directing users to specific, role-appropriate dashboards (e.g., `/dashboards/myhr#leave` for employees, `/dashboards/my-team#requests` for approvers) based on the email's context.
