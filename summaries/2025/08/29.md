# Activity Summary for 29/08/2025

## 10:52:01
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/layouts/dashboard4.vue` file on August 29th, 2025, between 10:12 AM and 10:15 AM.  The primary change involves the inclusion/exclusion of a `<Screenshot>` component within the template section.  The component was commented out and then uncommented multiple times within a short period.  The rest of the file, including the script and style sections, remained largely consistent across all revisions.  The script section consistently uses components like `Header`, `SnackbarAlert`, and `Screenshot`, indicating a consistent structure and reliance on these reusable components.  The styling consistently focuses on the `.v-menu__content` class for rounded corners and scrollbar hiding.
