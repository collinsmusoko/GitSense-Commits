# Activity Summary for 29/08/2025

## 10:52:01
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/layouts/dashboard4.vue` file on August 29th, 2025, between 10:12 AM and 10:15 AM.  The primary change involves the inclusion/exclusion of a `<Screenshot>` component within the template section.  The component was commented out and then uncommented multiple times within a short period.  The rest of the file, including the script and style sections, remained largely consistent across all revisions.  The script section consistently uses components like `Header`, `SnackbarAlert`, and `Screenshot`, indicating a consistent structure and reliance on these reusable components.  The styling consistently focuses on the `.v-menu__content` class for rounded corners and scrollbar hiding.


## 16:59:09
The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/pages/dashboards/myhr.vue` file underwent two revisions on August 29th, 2025.  The key difference between the two commits (16:21:59 and 16:25:09) lies in the `<template>` section.  The first version commented out the `<SelfServiceHub>` component, while the second version uncommented it, making the component active in the template.


The script section remained largely unchanged, containing numerous asynchronous methods (`initialize`, `groupByPolicyCategories`, `getEligibleEvents`, `lateInit`, `getTeamWfhList`, `getTeamLeaveList`, `getUsers`, `getUsersFromServer`, `getData`, `getUsersCompanyObj`) interacting with a backend API (`/configuration/required/project/`, `/shiftconfig/getShiftConfig/`, `/leaveconfig/getLeaveConfig`, `/payrollconfig/get/config/`, `/coreconfig/getcoreconfig`, `/requests/get/events`, `/wfh/request/dept`, `/leave/request/department/`, `/users/get/users`, `/companies/`, `/companies/user-company`, `/letter/template/company/`, `/letter/template/key-hint`) to fetch and process configuration data, user information, leave requests, and other HR-related details.  The code extensively uses `this.$axios` for API calls and `this.$store` for Vuex state management.  The `getUsers` method shows a strategy for efficient user retrieval, utilizing a hash for verification before fetching from the server. The `getData` method is marked as deprecated.  The code also uses Vuex getters (`getUsers`, `getToken`, `getUser`, `getAllUsersHash`, `getLogin`) to access application state.  Both versions show a consistent structure and functionality; only the template's rendering of the `SelfServiceHub` component changed.
