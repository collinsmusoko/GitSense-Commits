# Activity Summary for 26/08/2025

## 11:24:50
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/bulk_uploads.service.js`, focusing on enhancements to the `generateLeaveBalancesUpload` and `processLeaveBalancesUpload` functions.  These functions handle generating and processing Excel spreadsheets for leave balances.

The initial versions (10:26:05, 10:26:19) establish the core functionality: fetching user data, leave configurations, and generating an Excel sheet with leave balances.  The `isUserEligibleForLeave` function, used in both functions, determines leave eligibility based on user attributes and configuration.


Subsequent updates (10:28:06, 10:32:34, 10:38:31) refine the handling of the `editable` flag for leave balances in the generated Excel sheet.  The logic ensures that cells are locked (non-editable) if the leave type is disabled at the company level or if the user is not eligible for that leave type, based on the existing user's leave record or configuration. The 10:32:34 version clearly documents the conditions for locking a cell.


The final versions (11:00:07, 11:22:30, 11:22:50) introduce enhancements to the Excel sheet generation. The 11:00:07 update adds options to `leaveSheet.protect` to improve the spreadsheet's formatting (`formatCells`, `formatColumns`, `formatRows`, `autoFilter`, `sort`).  The 11:22:30 and 11:22:50 versions further refine the cell locking logic by prioritizing company-level leave type enabling status before checking user eligibility and the `editable` flag;  This significantly clarifies the conditions under which a cell should be locked.  The overall structure and core logic remain unchanged; changes focus on access control (editable cells) and spreadsheet appearance/functionality.  The timestamps reflect a focused period of development and refinement.
