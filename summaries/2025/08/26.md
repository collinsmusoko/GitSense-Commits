# Activity Summary for 26/08/2025

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/bulk_uploads.service.js`, focusing on enhancements to the `generateLeaveBalancesUpload` and `processLeaveBalancesUpload` functions.  These functions handle generating and processing Excel spreadsheets for leave balances.

The initial versions (10:26:05, 10:26:19) establish the core functionality: fetching user data, leave configurations, and generating an Excel sheet with leave balances.  The `isUserEligibleForLeave` function, used in both functions, determines leave eligibility based on user attributes and configuration.


Subsequent updates (10:28:06, 10:32:34, 10:38:31) refine the handling of the `editable` flag for leave balances in the generated Excel sheet.  The logic ensures that cells are locked (non-editable) if the leave type is disabled at the company level or if the user is not eligible for that leave type, based on the existing user's leave record or configuration. The 10:32:34 version clearly documents the conditions for locking a cell.


The final versions (11:00:07, 11:22:30, 11:22:50) introduce enhancements to the Excel sheet generation. The 11:00:07 update adds options to `leaveSheet.protect` to improve the spreadsheet's formatting (`formatCells`, `formatColumns`, `formatRows`, `autoFilter`, `sort`).  The 11:22:30 and 11:22:50 versions further refine the cell locking logic by prioritizing company-level leave type enabling status before checking user eligibility and the `editable` flag;  This significantly clarifies the conditions under which a cell should be locked.  The overall structure and core logic remain unchanged; changes focus on access control (editable cells) and spreadsheet appearance/functionality.  The timestamps reflect a focused period of development and refinement.

The code implements two main functions: `generateLeaveBalancesUpload` and `processLeaveBalancesUpload`.  Both functions operate on leave balance data related to employees within a company, utilizing an Excel spreadsheet as an interface.

`generateLeaveBalancesUpload` (timestamp: 26/08/2025, 11:35:31) generates an Excel file containing employee leave balances. It retrieves user data from a database, including employee ID, name, department, designation, and leave balances. The function then constructs an Excel workbook with a 'Leave Balances' sheet, populating it with this data.  Leave types are dynamically determined from a configuration and eligibility for each leave type is checked based on user attributes.  Cells representing leave balances are conditionally locked or unlocked based on eligibility and leave type configuration. The generated Excel file is then sent as a response.  Key data structures used include `User`, `CoreConfig`, and `LeaveConfig` models obtained from Mongoose.  The function utilizes `ExcelJS` for Excel manipulation and a custom `toSnakeCase` function for string conversion. Error handling is included for database queries and file generation.

`processLeaveBalancesUpload` processes an uploaded Excel file containing leave balance updates. It reads the file, retrieves corresponding user data, and updates the database with the new leave balances. The function ensures that only eligible users can have their leave balances modified, and generates transaction logs recording the updates.  Similar to the `generateLeaveBalancesUpload` function, it relies heavily on database interactions (`User` model and `LeaveConfig` model) and uses the `toSnakeCase` function and  `isUserEligibleForLeave` function for data processing and validation. The function uses `bulkWrite` for efficient database updates.

Both functions share common functionalities:  database interaction with `User` and `LeaveConfig` models, use of the `toSnakeCase` helper function, and a core eligibility check (`isUserEligibleForLeave`).  The key difference is that one generates the Excel file, while the other processes updates from an uploaded Excel file. Both functions handle potential errors robustly.
