# Activity Summary for 27/08/2025

## 10:40:55
The provided log shows extensive configuration changes for a system, likely an HRMS application.  Significant updates across multiple timestamps modify database connection strings (DATABASE_URL, QUEUE_DATABASE_URL, MOBILE_CENTRAL_DB, DATABASE_URL_CENTRAL), API URLs (TRANSLATE_API_URL, TRANSLATE_API_BASE, API_URL, CENTRAL_URL, ERP_API, etc.), AWS credentials (SECRET_KEY_AWS, SECRET_ID_AWS, ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION, BUCKET_NAME), SMTP settings (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD), and various other settings like JWT configurations, client URLs, and email addresses.

There is a pattern of using both localhost and production URLs, suggesting development and deployment environments are managed within this single `.env` file. Several entries refer to `devnhr.com`, indicating a potential domain used for the development environment.  The numerous API keys, secrets and passwords highlight the sensitive nature of the file.  Note that no summary is provided for this file as instructed in the prompt.


## 11:52:49
The log shows several code modifications between 11:11 AM and 11:28 AM on August 27, 2025.  The most significant changes relate to the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/processFlowApplications/processes.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/onboardings/new-employee/index.vue` files.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/processFlowApplications/processes.vue` underwent two minor revisions within a short time frame (11:11:47 and 11:12:27). The only noticeable alteration was changing the button text color from `red--text` to `white--text` in a `<v-btn>` component. This suggests a simple style adjustment.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/onboardings/new-employee/index.vue` file shows a series of changes between 11:25:22 and 11:28:49. These modifications focused on the styling and heading level of the new employee onboarding component. Initially, the heading was an `<h4>` tag with `fontWeight900`, then changed to `fontWeight100`, then to `fontWeight500`, and finally, the `<h4>` tag was replaced with `<h1>` in 11:27:24. In the last change at 11:28:49, the entire card title section was commented out, suggesting a potential temporary removal or restructuring of the title section within the component.  The changes highlight an iterative process of adjusting the visual presentation of the heading within the onboarding component.  The content itself (data, methods) within this file remained unchanged throughout these revisions.
