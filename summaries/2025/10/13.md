# Activity Summary for 13/10/2025

## 10:33:30
The `package.json` file for the `babilou-api` project, last updated on `13/10/2025, 10:10:42`, outlines a robust Node.js application (`name: "api"`) with extensive functionalities.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-api/package.json`**

*   **Scripts:** Configured for development (`dev` using `nodemon`), direct Node execution (`nodev`), and a `start` script that allocates a larger heap size (`--max_old_space_size=4096`), suggesting potential memory-intensive operations. A `test` script is present but undefined.
*   **Core Dependencies:**
    *   **Microsoft Integration:** Includes `@azure/msal-node` and `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` for Azure authentication and Microsoft Graph API interactions.
    *   **Proprietary Modules:** Heavily relies on numerous `@nathangroup/` packages, such as `apm`, `attendance`, `claim`, `leave`, `payroll`, `letter`, and `wfh`, along with corresponding email modules (`@nathangroup/*-email`), indicating an enterprise application with deep integration into an internal ecosystem for HR, workflow, and payroll management.
    *   **Email Services:** Utilizes `@sendgrid/mail` and `nodemailer` in addition to the proprietary email modules.
    *   **Cloud & File Handling:** Integrates with AWS via `aws-sdk` and `multer-s3` for S3 uploads, alongside `express-fileupload`, `multer`, `firebase-admin`, and a comprehensive set of document processing libraries including `exceljs`, `pdf-creator-node`, `pdfkit`, `xlsx`, `csv-writer`, `canvas`, and `@syncfusion/ej2-documenteditor` for handling various file types, PDF generation, and document editing.
    *   **Web Framework & Security:** Built on `express`, incorporating security middleware like `helmet` and `xss-clean`, logging with `morgan`, and `cors` for cross-origin requests.
    *   **Database & Caching:** Uses `mongoose` for MongoDB interaction and `ioredis` for Redis caching.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Employs `passport` with `passport-jwt` for authentication, `speakeasy` for two-factor authentication, and `firebase-admin`, likely for Firebase-based services or authentication.
    *   **Scheduling & Process Management:** Includes `node-cron` for scheduled tasks and `pm2` for process management.
    *   **Utilities:** A wide array of utility libraries are present, such as `axios` for HTTP requests, `joi` for validation, `moment-timezone` for date/time handling, `uuid` for unique IDs, `crypto-js`, and `socket.io` for real-time communication.
*   **Development Dependencies:** Standard development tools like `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `dotenv` for environment variables, `jsonwebtoken` for token handling, `lodash` for utility functions, and `nodemon` for automatic server restarts during development.
*   **Node.js Version:** Specifies `node: 14.18.0` via Volta.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Internal Module Usage:** The predominant pattern is the reliance on a large suite of `@nathangroup/` modules, suggesting a highly customized backend built around specific business logic and workflows.
*   **Comprehensive Document & Email Processing:** The application is clearly designed to handle a variety of documents (PDFs, Excel, CSV) and has robust email notification capabilities, often tied directly to the internal modules (e.g., `attendance-email`, `claim-email`).
*   **Full-Stack Ecosystem:** The dependencies indicate a complex, full-featured API serving various needs from authentication (Azure, Firebase, JWT, 2FA) to data storage (MongoDB, Redis), real-time communication, cloud integration (AWS S3), and internal system integrations.

## 13:33:29
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`. This Vue component appears to be central to an admin panel's employment management section, handling user addition, searching, filtering, and displaying employee statistics.

**File-specific Updates for `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`:**

*   **13/10/2025, 12:49:51**: This timestamp captures a version of the component that includes functionality for adding new users (conditionally rendered), a comprehensive employee listing section, a search bar, male/female employee statistics with percentages, and various administrative actions like "Check Fields," "Expiry Documents," "Bulk Bank Details Upload," "Bulk Salary Adjustment," and "Download Database." It also features an "Advance Search" option with dynamic filter chips displaying active search criteria such as ID, Status, Employee Name, Email, Designation, Company, and Department.
*   **13/10/2025, 12:50:28**: A minor textual correction was made within the advanced search filter display. The label "Filter byyyyy:" was updated to "Filter by:".
*   **13/10/2025, 12:51:50**: Another minor textual change occurred. The tooltip text for the "Advance Search" icon was modified from "Advance Search" to "Advance Search.......".
*   **13/10/2025, 12:53:17**: The tooltip text for the "Advance Search" icon was reverted to its original form, changing back from "Advance Search......." to "Advance Search".

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

All recorded changes are confined to minor textual adjustments within the `<template>` section of the `employment.vue` component. The modifications involved simple string corrections or temporary alterations to display labels and tooltips, indicating a focus on refining user interface text rather than significant functional or structural changes to the component's logic. The timestamps are very close together, suggesting rapid, iterative fine-tuning of the front-end display elements.

## 14:33:26
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/pages/expiry_documents/index.vue`.

**File-specific Updates:**
The only identifiable change across all entries for this file is a minor text correction in the UI. Specifically, the text "Backsss" associated with a back navigation button (using `mdi-arrow-left` icon) was corrected to "Back".

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The significant change, the text correction, occurred between `13/10/2025, 13:43:56` (where "Backsss" was present) and `13/10/2025, 13:45:42` (where it was corrected to "Back").

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
A clear pattern is that all subsequent log entries for this file (`13/10/2025, 13:49:56`, `13/10/2025, 13:51:05`, `13/10/2025, 13:52:26`, `13/10/2025, 13:53:38`, `13/10/2025, 13:54:34`) show the exact same content as the entry at `13/10/2025, 13:45:42`. This indicates that no further code modifications were made to this specific file within the scope of these log entries after the initial text correction. This could imply frequent saving, an automated backup, or a logging process that captures file states without explicit code alterations.

## 15:33:53
The log details changes across two main Vue components related to employee management in the Babilou admin project.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/pages/expiry_documents/index.vue:** This file defines a Vue component responsible for displaying and managing employee document expiry. Key features include:
    *   A primary view showing a list of employees with documents near expiry or already expired, grouped by user, along with an avatar and name.
    *   A duration selector to filter documents (e.g., 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months).
    *   A secondary panel, activated upon selecting an employee, to display their personal and document information.
    *   An "Edit Document Details" dialog (`v-dialog`) that allows HR admins to update specific document details like Emirates ID, MOL, Passport, and Visa numbers and their expiry dates. It also supports viewing existing attachments, toggling their status, and uploading new files.
    *   **Timestamp:** This file was logged multiple times between 13/10/2025, 14:38:39 and 13/10/2025, 15:13:28. However, the code content provided for each of these timestamps is identical, indicating no substantive code changes within these specific log entries.

*   **/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue:** This Vue component handles general employee directory and management functions. It features:
    *   An option to add new users (`addUserFlag == true`) using an `AddNew` component.
    *   A search bar for filtering employees by name or tags.
    *   Display of male and female employee counts and percentages.
    *   Action buttons for "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Bank Details Upload", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", and "Download Database".
    *   An expandable "Advance Search" form (`expandFilterForm`) with chips to show active filters for employee ID, status, name, email, designation, company, and department.
    *   **Timestamp:** This file was logged at 13/10/2025, 15:22:22, and again at 13/10/2025, 15:23:45 and 15:23:55. The code content provided across these entries is identical, showing no changes.

*   **/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue:** This appears to be an evolved version of the `employment.vue` component, first logged shortly after the last `employment.vue` entry. It introduces several enhancements:
    *   Removes certain bulk operation buttons present in `employment.vue` (e.g., "Pro Rata", "Check Fields", "Bulk Bank Details Upload", "Bulk Salary Adjustment"), suggesting a focus shift or refactoring.
    *   Integrates a direct data export functionality for the "Download Database" button using a `<download-excel>` component with specific data and field definitions, providing a generated file name incorporating `HOME_NAME`.
    *   Significantly expands the "Advance Search" capabilities, adding filters for "Cost Center", "Date of Joining" (DOJ) with "From" and "To" date range selectors, and "Last Working Date" (LWD) with similar date range functionality, specifically visible when filtering by 'Inactive' status.
    *   **Timestamp:** This file was logged at 13/10/2025, 15:27:45 and 13/10/2025, 15:27:51. Similar to the other files, the content provided is identical for these entries.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The most significant functional changes are represented by the introduction of `employmentnew.vue` at **13/10/2025, 15:27:45**, which indicates a shift towards more refined data filtering and export capabilities for employee records. Other timestamps for both files show static code, implying either minor, unlogged changes or simply multiple saves/logs without code modifications in the provided snippets.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Employee Management Focus:** All changed files are central to an administrative panel for managing employee data and documents.
*   **Vue.js and Vuetify:** The entire codebase is built using the Vue.js framework and the Vuetify component library, characterized by components like `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-dialog`, and `v-date-picker`.
*   **Advanced Filtering and Search:** There's a clear emphasis on providing comprehensive search and filtering options for employee data, which is further enhanced in `employmentnew.vue`.
*   **Data Export:** The ability to download employee databases is a recurring feature, explicitly handled by a `download-excel` component in the newer `employmentnew.vue`.
*   **UI/UX Consistency:** The use of `rounded-xl` classes, `box-shadow`, and specific color palettes (`primary--text`, `blue-grey--text`) suggests a consistent design language across the admin interface.
*   **Identical Code Across Timestamps:** A notable pattern is the repeated logging of identical code for the same file across several timestamps, suggesting frequent commit/save operations without actual code modifications in the provided snippets, or perhaps partial logs that don't capture the actual diffs.

## 16:35:04
This log details changes to the `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/pages/expiry_documents/index.vue` file, with the last recorded update on `13/10/2025, 15:40:57`.

The file is a Vue.js component designed for an admin dashboard, specifically for managing "Expiry Documents".

**Key Updates and Features:**

*   **Document Expiry Overview:** The primary interface displays a list of employee documents that are near expiry or have already expired. Users can filter this list by duration (1, 3, 6, 9, or 12 months) using a `v-select` component.
*   **Statistics Display:** Summary statistics, such as the count and name of different expiry categories (e.g., "Expired," "Due in 30 days"), are presented prominently using `v-card` elements with a distinct right border.
*   **Employee-centric Grouping:** Expired documents are grouped by employee, showing their avatar and name. A search icon (`mdi-magnify`) allows for selecting an employee to view more details. Individual document cards within this list highlight expiry dates and feature a red right border.
*   **Employee and Document Information Panel:** Upon selecting an employee, a dedicated panel appears on the right, providing detailed information:
    *   **Employee Details:** Includes the employee's avatar, full name (capitalized), email, and phone number.
    *   **Document Details:** Lists all relevant documents for the selected employee, showing the document name, ID, and expiry date. An alert icon (`mdi-alert-circle-outline`) visually indicates if a document is past its deadline.
*   **Document Editing Dialog:** A `v-dialog` allows administrators to edit specific document details. This dialog:
    *   Supports updating the ID number and expiry date for key document types like Emirates ID, MOL, Passport, and Visa, using `v-text-field` and `v-date-picker` components. The visibility of these fields is controlled by flags (`emiratesIdFlag`, `molFlag`, etc.).
    *   Lists existing attachments for the document type being edited, allowing users to view them (`mdi-eye-outline`) and toggle their status via a `v-switch`.
    *   Provides a `v-file-input` for attaching new files.
    *   Includes "Close" and "Update" buttons to manage changes, with the "Update" button (`progessBtnCall`) potentially indicating a loading state.
*   **Responsive Design:** The component incorporates responsive styling, adjusting content height (`max-height`) based on Vuetify breakpoints (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`) to ensure usability across different screen sizes.
*   **Role-based Access (Indicated):** While not fully implemented in the provided snippet, the presence of `isHRAdminRole` and `isAdminRole` data properties suggests an intention to implement role-based access control.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vuetify Component Usage:** The file heavily relies on Vuetify components for its UI structure, layout, and interactive elements (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-dialog`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`).
*   **Date Pickers and Menus:** A consistent pattern for date input involves `v-menu` wrapping `v-text-field` and `v-date-picker` for expiry date fields across multiple document types.
*   **Data Filtering and Display:** The use of `v-for` loops to iterate through document lists, grouped by user, and `v-model` for two-way data binding in input fields is prevalent.
*   **Custom Filters:** Vue filters like `ticketingDateFormatter` and `uppercase` are used to format displayed data.

## 17:35:06
The code changes log highlights development activity across several Vue components related to employee management and onboarding functionalities within a `babilou-admin` project. All recorded changes occurred on **13/10/2025**, concentrated between 17:11:35 and 17:30:20.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/reuseable/leaves.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 17:11:35 to 17:13:17.
    *   **Key Information:** This component displays employee leave information. It includes logic to filter leave types dynamically based on user attributes such as gender, marital status, religion, employment type, and date of joining. For instance, Maternity leaves are only shown to female and married employees, Hajj leaves to Muslim employees, and Parental leaves to non-single employees. Ambassador leaves are restricted to academic employment types, and Annual leaves consider probation days. Each leave type is assigned a specific display color. The component consistently uses `moment` for date calculations and `_.startCase` for formatting leave names.
    *   **Pattern:** All logged entries for this file show identical code. This suggests either frequent saves without functional changes, or changes that were immediately reverted, or an automated commit process. Debug `console.log` statements prefixed with "@ mobeen" are present in the `keyNameRegex` and `getLeaveColor` methods.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/pages/onboarding_nnhr/stepper-index.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 13/10/2025, 17:26:04.
    *   **Key Information:** This component defines a multi-step onboarding process, guiding users through "Employee Details," "Upload Document," and "Contract Upload." The "Employee Details" step collects basic information like name, email, phone, designation, date of joining, address, and contract type. It leverages Vuetify components for UI and includes `asyncData` for fetching initial user, company, and onboarding data. There's an incomplete integration for `openweather-apis` and a commented-out `console.log` for geolocation.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/pages/onboarding/create.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 13/10/2025, 17:26:18.
    *   **Key Information:** This component facilitates the creation of new employee applications. It supports two employee types: "New Employee" and "Existing Employee," with different process types accordingly (e.g., "New Visa Request," "Visa Renewal Request"). The form captures extensive details including contract type, process type, employee name, email, date of joining, status, company name, and allows attaching multiple documents via a dedicated dialog with drag-and-drop functionality. A snackbar provides user feedback.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 13/10/2025, 17:29:52 and 17:30:20.
    *   **Key Information:** This administrative component provides a comprehensive interface for managing employees. It features a search bar, displays a summary of male and female employee counts and percentages, and offers an advanced search filter with chips to refine results by employee ID, status, name, email, designation, company, department, cost center, date of joining, and last working date. The component also includes functionality to download employee data (excel export) and a button to add new users, which is handled by an `AddNew` child component.
    *   **Changes between timestamps:** A minor update occurred, adding a `v-if="!isTeamLead"` condition to the "Download Database" button. This restricts the data download functionality for users who are identified as team leads, indicating a permission-based access control was implemented or refined.

**Recurring Patterns:**

*   **Date Handling:** The `moment.js` library is consistently used across components for date formatting and calculations (e.g., `date_of_joining`, `canAvail` for leaves).
*   **UI Framework:** Vuetify components are extensively utilized for building the user interface, including cards, rows, columns, buttons, text fields, selects, menus, date pickers, steppers, radio groups, chips, and tooltips.
*   **Data Fetching/Authentication:** `asyncData` and methods involving `this.$axios.$get` are common patterns for fetching data from an API, typically including an authorization header with a bearer token retrieved from the Vuex store.
*   **Utility Libraries:** `lodash` is imported and used for utility functions like `_.startCase` and `_.cloneDeep`.
*   **Debugging:** The presence of `console.log` statements, particularly the "@ mobeen" prefixed ones, indicates debugging activities during development.
