# Activity Summary for 13/10/2025

## 10:33:30
The `package.json` file for the `babilou-api` project, last updated on `13/10/2025, 10:10:42`, outlines a robust Node.js application (`name: "api"`) with extensive functionalities.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-api/package.json`**

*   **Scripts:** Configured for development (`dev` using `nodemon`), direct Node execution (`nodev`), and a `start` script that allocates a larger heap size (`--max_old_space_size=4096`), suggesting potential memory-intensive operations. A `test` script is present but undefined.
*   **Core Dependencies:**
    *   **Microsoft Integration:** Includes `@azure/msal-node` and `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` for Azure authentication and Microsoft Graph API interactions.
    *   **Proprietary Modules:** Heavily relies on numerous `@nathangroup/` packages, such as `apm`, `attendance`, `claim`, `leave`, `payroll`, `letter`, and `wfh`, along with corresponding email modules (`@nathangroup/*-email`), indicating an enterprise application with deep integration into an internal ecosystem for HR, workflow, and payroll management.
    *   **Email Services:** Utilizes `@sendgrid/mail` and `nodemailer` in addition to the proprietary email modules.
    *   **Cloud & File Handling:** Integrates with AWS via `aws-sdk` and `multer-s3` for S3 uploads, alongside `express-fileupload`, `multer`, `firebase-admin`, and a comprehensive set of document processing libraries including `exceljs`, `pdf-creator-node`, `pdfkit`, `xlsx`, `csv-writer`, `canvas`, and `@syncfusion/ej2-documenteditor` for handling various file types, PDF generation, and document editing.
    *   **Web Framework & Security:** Built on `express`, incorporating security middleware like `helmet` and `xss-clean`, logging with `morgan`, and `cors` for cross-origin requests.
    *   **Database & Caching:** Uses `mongoose` for MongoDB interaction and `ioredis` for Redis caching.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Employs `passport` with `passport-jwt` for authentication, `speakeasy` for two-factor authentication, and `firebase-admin`, likely for Firebase-based services or authentication.
    *   **Scheduling & Process Management:** Includes `node-cron` for scheduled tasks and `pm2` for process management.
    *   **Utilities:** A wide array of utility libraries are present, such as `axios` for HTTP requests, `joi` for validation, `moment-timezone` for date/time handling, `uuid` for unique IDs, `crypto-js`, and `socket.io` for real-time communication.
*   **Development Dependencies:** Standard development tools like `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `dotenv` for environment variables, `jsonwebtoken` for token handling, `lodash` for utility functions, and `nodemon` for automatic server restarts during development.
*   **Node.js Version:** Specifies `node: 14.18.0` via Volta.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Internal Module Usage:** The predominant pattern is the reliance on a large suite of `@nathangroup/` modules, suggesting a highly customized backend built around specific business logic and workflows.
*   **Comprehensive Document & Email Processing:** The application is clearly designed to handle a variety of documents (PDFs, Excel, CSV) and has robust email notification capabilities, often tied directly to the internal modules (e.g., `attendance-email`, `claim-email`).
*   **Full-Stack Ecosystem:** The dependencies indicate a complex, full-featured API serving various needs from authentication (Azure, Firebase, JWT, 2FA) to data storage (MongoDB, Redis), real-time communication, cloud integration (AWS S3), and internal system integrations.

## 13:33:29
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`. This Vue component appears to be central to an admin panel's employment management section, handling user addition, searching, filtering, and displaying employee statistics.

**File-specific Updates for `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`:**

*   **13/10/2025, 12:49:51**: This timestamp captures a version of the component that includes functionality for adding new users (conditionally rendered), a comprehensive employee listing section, a search bar, male/female employee statistics with percentages, and various administrative actions like "Check Fields," "Expiry Documents," "Bulk Bank Details Upload," "Bulk Salary Adjustment," and "Download Database." It also features an "Advance Search" option with dynamic filter chips displaying active search criteria such as ID, Status, Employee Name, Email, Designation, Company, and Department.
*   **13/10/2025, 12:50:28**: A minor textual correction was made within the advanced search filter display. The label "Filter byyyyy:" was updated to "Filter by:".
*   **13/10/2025, 12:51:50**: Another minor textual change occurred. The tooltip text for the "Advance Search" icon was modified from "Advance Search" to "Advance Search.......".
*   **13/10/2025, 12:53:17**: The tooltip text for the "Advance Search" icon was reverted to its original form, changing back from "Advance Search......." to "Advance Search".

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

All recorded changes are confined to minor textual adjustments within the `<template>` section of the `employment.vue` component. The modifications involved simple string corrections or temporary alterations to display labels and tooltips, indicating a focus on refining user interface text rather than significant functional or structural changes to the component's logic. The timestamps are very close together, suggesting rapid, iterative fine-tuning of the front-end display elements.

## 14:33:26
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/pages/expiry_documents/index.vue`.

**File-specific Updates:**
The only identifiable change across all entries for this file is a minor text correction in the UI. Specifically, the text "Backsss" associated with a back navigation button (using `mdi-arrow-left` icon) was corrected to "Back".

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The significant change, the text correction, occurred between `13/10/2025, 13:43:56` (where "Backsss" was present) and `13/10/2025, 13:45:42` (where it was corrected to "Back").

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
A clear pattern is that all subsequent log entries for this file (`13/10/2025, 13:49:56`, `13/10/2025, 13:51:05`, `13/10/2025, 13:52:26`, `13/10/2025, 13:53:38`, `13/10/2025, 13:54:34`) show the exact same content as the entry at `13/10/2025, 13:45:42`. This indicates that no further code modifications were made to this specific file within the scope of these log entries after the initial text correction. This could imply frequent saving, an automated backup, or a logging process that captures file states without explicit code alterations.
