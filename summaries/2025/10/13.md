# Activity Summary for 13/10/2025

## 10:33:30
The `package.json` file for the `babilou-api` project, last updated on `13/10/2025, 10:10:42`, outlines a robust Node.js application (`name: "api"`) with extensive functionalities.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-api/package.json`**

*   **Scripts:** Configured for development (`dev` using `nodemon`), direct Node execution (`nodev`), and a `start` script that allocates a larger heap size (`--max_old_space_size=4096`), suggesting potential memory-intensive operations. A `test` script is present but undefined.
*   **Core Dependencies:**
    *   **Microsoft Integration:** Includes `@azure/msal-node` and `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` for Azure authentication and Microsoft Graph API interactions.
    *   **Proprietary Modules:** Heavily relies on numerous `@nathangroup/` packages, such as `apm`, `attendance`, `claim`, `leave`, `payroll`, `letter`, and `wfh`, along with corresponding email modules (`@nathangroup/*-email`), indicating an enterprise application with deep integration into an internal ecosystem for HR, workflow, and payroll management.
    *   **Email Services:** Utilizes `@sendgrid/mail` and `nodemailer` in addition to the proprietary email modules.
    *   **Cloud & File Handling:** Integrates with AWS via `aws-sdk` and `multer-s3` for S3 uploads, alongside `express-fileupload`, `multer`, `firebase-admin`, and a comprehensive set of document processing libraries including `exceljs`, `pdf-creator-node`, `pdfkit`, `xlsx`, `csv-writer`, `canvas`, and `@syncfusion/ej2-documenteditor` for handling various file types, PDF generation, and document editing.
    *   **Web Framework & Security:** Built on `express`, incorporating security middleware like `helmet` and `xss-clean`, logging with `morgan`, and `cors` for cross-origin requests.
    *   **Database & Caching:** Uses `mongoose` for MongoDB interaction and `ioredis` for Redis caching.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Employs `passport` with `passport-jwt` for authentication, `speakeasy` for two-factor authentication, and `firebase-admin`, likely for Firebase-based services or authentication.
    *   **Scheduling & Process Management:** Includes `node-cron` for scheduled tasks and `pm2` for process management.
    *   **Utilities:** A wide array of utility libraries are present, such as `axios` for HTTP requests, `joi` for validation, `moment-timezone` for date/time handling, `uuid` for unique IDs, `crypto-js`, and `socket.io` for real-time communication.
*   **Development Dependencies:** Standard development tools like `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `dotenv` for environment variables, `jsonwebtoken` for token handling, `lodash` for utility functions, and `nodemon` for automatic server restarts during development.
*   **Node.js Version:** Specifies `node: 14.18.0` via Volta.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Internal Module Usage:** The predominant pattern is the reliance on a large suite of `@nathangroup/` modules, suggesting a highly customized backend built around specific business logic and workflows.
*   **Comprehensive Document & Email Processing:** The application is clearly designed to handle a variety of documents (PDFs, Excel, CSV) and has robust email notification capabilities, often tied directly to the internal modules (e.g., `attendance-email`, `claim-email`).
*   **Full-Stack Ecosystem:** The dependencies indicate a complex, full-featured API serving various needs from authentication (Azure, Firebase, JWT, 2FA) to data storage (MongoDB, Redis), real-time communication, cloud integration (AWS S3), and internal system integrations.
