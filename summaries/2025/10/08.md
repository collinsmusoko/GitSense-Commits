The `shifts.service.js` file, timestamped `08/10/2025, 09:18:22`, contains updates related to shift management functionalities.

The file includes new or modified service functions:

1.  **`getUserOffDays`**: This function is designed to retrieve the count of off-days for a user within specified dates, differentiating between 'shift' type schedules and other schedule types. It queries the `Shifts` collection to determine the number of relevant off-day entries.
2.  **`autoAddShifts`**: This is a comprehensive function for automatically generating and assigning shifts over a specified date range. Its key functionalities include:
    *   **Date Range Processing**: It iterates through weeks and days within a given `from_date` and `to_date`.
    *   **Dynamic User Sorting**: Users are sorted differently each week (by `user_name`, `email`, or `createdDate`) for randomization or balanced assignment. Users with existing leaves are prioritized to be moved to the front.
    *   **Employee Requirements**: It calculates the total employees required for shifts, including extra employees, and validates if enough users are available.
    *   **Shift Assignment Logic**:
        *   It defines off-days for users based on a modulo 7 calculation.
        *   It assigns `base_employees` to shifts, ensuring no conflicts with existing leaves or shifts.
        *   It identifies `missing_employees` for each shift day.
        *   `filler_employes` are then used to cover these missing slots, with checks for existing leaves or shifts to prevent over-assignment.
    *   **Prioritization**: Shifts are sorted by a predefined priority order ('Critical', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'), and shift days are sorted based on `peak_days`.
    *   **Conflict Prevention**: Throughout the assignment process, there are recurring checks to ensure users are not assigned shifts when they are on leave or already have another shift.

The service has extensive dependencies, importing numerous Mongoose models (`Requests`, `User`, `Companies`, `Shifts`, `ShiftConfig`, etc.), helper modules (`NotificationHelper`, `EventObserverHelper`, `ShiftsHelper`), email utilities, and a `shift_lock.service`, indicating its central role in the application's shift management workflow. It heavily utilizes `lodash` for various array and object manipulations, such as sorting and uniqueness checks.
