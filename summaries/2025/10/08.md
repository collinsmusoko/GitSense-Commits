# Activity Summary for 08/10/2025

## 09:42:34
The `shifts.service.js` file, timestamped `08/10/2025, 09:18:22`, contains updates related to shift management functionalities.

The file includes new or modified service functions:

1.  **`getUserOffDays`**: This function is designed to retrieve the count of off-days for a user within specified dates, differentiating between 'shift' type schedules and other schedule types. It queries the `Shifts` collection to determine the number of relevant off-day entries.
2.  **`autoAddShifts`**: This is a comprehensive function for automatically generating and assigning shifts over a specified date range. Its key functionalities include:
    *   **Date Range Processing**: It iterates through weeks and days within a given `from_date` and `to_date`.
    *   **Dynamic User Sorting**: Users are sorted differently each week (by `user_name`, `email`, or `createdDate`) for randomization or balanced assignment. Users with existing leaves are prioritized to be moved to the front.
    *   **Employee Requirements**: It calculates the total employees required for shifts, including extra employees, and validates if enough users are available.
    *   **Shift Assignment Logic**:
        *   It defines off-days for users based on a modulo 7 calculation.
        *   It assigns `base_employees` to shifts, ensuring no conflicts with existing leaves or shifts.
        *   It identifies `missing_employees` for each shift day.
        *   `filler_employes` are then used to cover these missing slots, with checks for existing leaves or shifts to prevent over-assignment.
    *   **Prioritization**: Shifts are sorted by a predefined priority order ('Critical', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'), and shift days are sorted based on `peak_days`.
    *   **Conflict Prevention**: Throughout the assignment process, there are recurring checks to ensure users are not assigned shifts when they are on leave or already have another shift.

The service has extensive dependencies, importing numerous Mongoose models (`Requests`, `User`, `Companies`, `Shifts`, `ShiftConfig`, etc.), helper modules (`NotificationHelper`, `EventObserverHelper`, `ShiftsHelper`), email utilities, and a `shift_lock.service`, indicating its central role in the application's shift management workflow. It heavily utilizes `lodash` for various array and object manipulations, such as sorting and uniqueness checks.

The changes log details modifications to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`. All updates occurred within a short timeframe on 08/10/2025.

**File-Specific Updates for `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`:**

*   **Initial State (08/10/2025, 10:03:38):** The component featured a calendar-based shift schedule display. Filter options for "location" and "department" were directly integrated into the main `v-card-title` section, alongside other action buttons for shift locking, logs, bulk uploads, and a shift roster dialog. Event and "more events" dialogs were already implemented for viewing shift details.

*   **UI/UX Refinement for Filtering (08/10/2025, 10:05:28 and 10:05:48):**
    *   The `workLocation` and `selectedDepartment` filter dropdowns were removed from the `v-card-title`.
    *   A new "Filter by:" text and a filter icon (`/adminCentral/filter.svg`) were introduced in their place. Clicking this icon now toggles an `expandFilterForm`.
    *   A new collapsible `v-card` section was added below the title bar, utilizing `v-expand-transition` and controlled by `expandFilterForm`. This new card now houses the `workLocation` and `selectedDepartment` `v-select` components, effectively creating an "Advanced Search" filter area. The `selectedDepartment` `v-select` was also updated to explicitly define `item-text` and `item-value` for its items.

*   **Internationalization (i18n) Adjustments (08/10/2025, 10:08:00, 10:08:14, and 10:08:31):**
    *   In a series of rapid changes, several internationalization keys (`$t('my_team.myTeam_filter_by')`, `$t("my_team.myTeam_advance_search")`, `$t('my_team.myTeam_department')`) were replaced with hardcoded English strings: "Filter by:", "Advanced Search", and "Department" respectively.

*   **Minor UI Polish (08/10/2025, 10:12:56):** The tooltip for the filter icon had its display position changed from `bottom` to `top`.

*   **Redundant Commits (08/10/2025, 10:16:08 and 10:18:27):** The last two entries for the file show identical code to the previous entry, indicating minor saves or re-commits without functional changes.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

*   The code consistently uses Vuetify components (`v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-select`, `v-calendar`, `v-tooltip`, `v-icon`, etc.) for building the UI.
*   Error handling for bulk shift upload (`bulkShift.error`, `bulkShift.fileValidation.message`) is a recurring pattern within the bulk upload dialog.
*   Shift display logic frequently checks for "off" shifts to display "---" instead of times (`shift.name.toLowerCase().includes('off') || (shift.abbreviation && shift.abbreviation.toLowerCase().includes('off'))`).
*   The `my_team` translation namespace is heavily used throughout the component, though some keys were later replaced by hardcoded strings.
