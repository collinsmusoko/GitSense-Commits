The provided log details significant updates to a Vue.js component, `attendanceCalendarView.vue`, primarily focused on enhancing attendance tracking and reporting features.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/attendance/attendanceCalendarView.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The last significant update was on **September 10, 2025, at 10:32:59**.
    *   **Core Functionality:** This file defines a comprehensive attendance management interface. It's structured into two main sections: a `FullCalendar` for visualizing attendance and a detailed employee data table.
    *   **Calendar View:**
        *   Integrates `FullCalendar` with `resourceTimelinePlugin` and `dayGridMonth` for displaying attendance events.
        *   Includes navigation buttons (`fc-prev-button`, `fc-next-button`) and a dynamic title (`toptitleTeamView`).
        *   Features an "Advanced Filter" section that can be expanded/collapsed, allowing users to filter attendance by `Location` and `Department` using `v-autocomplete` components.
        *   Custom rendering for calendar events (`v-slot:eventContent`) displays attendance remarks (e.g., "title - count") with dynamic colors determined by `getTrendColor`.
    *   **Employee Details View:**
        *   Displays detailed attendance records for selected remarks/dates in a `v-data-table`.
        *   The table presents employee names, start/end times, shifts, total working hours, and remarks.
        *   Custom styling is applied to chips displaying times, shifts, and remarks, with remark colors being dynamic based on `getRemarksColor`.
    *   **Reporting and Communication:**
        *   Includes a "Download Attendance Report" feature, activated via an Excel icon, which opens a dialog (`download_attendance_dialog`). This dialog allows users to filter reports by Department, Work Location, Employee, and a custom Date Range before exporting to Excel.
        *   A "Send Email Reminder" functionality is present, initiated via a mail icon, opening an `emailReminderPopup` dialog.
    *   **Dialogs:**
        *   `attendancePerDayForEmployeePopUp`: Displays individual punch-in/punch-out times for a specific employee on a given day in a `v-data-table`, with `punch_time` and `type` (e.g., "Unknown" or specific punch type) columns.
        *   `download_attendance_dialog`: Facilitates filtering and downloading attendance data as an Excel report.
        *   `emailReminderPopup`: An email sending interface (though the `EmailCard` component is commented out, suggesting ongoing development or a placeholder).
    *   **Styling:** Consistently uses `rounded-xl` for `v-card` elements and often includes `box-shadow`, indicating a modern, card-based UI design.
    *   **Dependencies:** Imports `lodash`, `FullCalendar`, `resourceTimelinePlugin`, `dayGridMonth`, and `moment` for data manipulation, calendar functionality, and date handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent UI Design:** The use of `v-card` with `rounded-xl` and `box-shadow` for major sections and dialogs is a strong recurring pattern, contributing to a unified, modern aesthetic.
*   **Filter and Search:** Filtering capabilities are prominent, both for the calendar view (location, department) and for report generation (department, location, employee, date range).
*   **Data Table Usage:** `v-data-table` is extensively used for displaying tabular data, customized with `v-slot` templates for specific column formatting and styling (e.g., `item.name`, `item.startTime`, `item.remarks`).
*   **Dynamic Styling:** Several elements, particularly attendance remarks and event content in the calendar, utilize functions like `getTrendColor` and `getRemarksColor` to apply dynamic background and text colors based on data values, enhancing visual information hierarchy.
*   **Icon-based Actions:** Common actions like filtering, downloading reports, and sending reminders are represented by descriptive SVG icons (`filter.svg`, `excel.svg`, `mail.svg`).
*   **Date and Time Handling:** `moment.js` is imported, and various custom filters like `requestsDateFormat`, `customTimeFormatCheckingTimeExist`, and `ticketingDateFormatter` are applied, indicating robust date and time formatting across the component.
