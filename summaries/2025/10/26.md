# Activity Summary for 26/10/2025

## 00:21:28
The changes primarily focus on enhancing document editing and request management functionalities within an administrative platform, particularly related to letter generation and employee requests.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/document-editor/wordeditor.vue`**
    *   **25/10/2025, 11:11:45:** This initial version of the Vue component establishes a comprehensive document editor using Syncfusion controls. It provides a user interface for creating, editing, saving (DOCX, PDF), and closing documents. A key feature is the ability to insert dynamic merge fields (text, table, image) into the document, managed through interactive list views and dialogs. The `reloadTableData` method dynamically populates the merge field lists based on provided `elements` data, mapping table fields to `TableStart` and `TableEnd` placeholders. PDF generation uses an external API endpoint `process.env.documenturl + 'api/DocumentEditor/DocToPDF'`.
    *   **25/10/2025, 11:34:33 - 25/10/2025, 11:38:21:** These subsequent timestamps for `wordeditor.vue` show minor, iterative changes to `console.log` statements within the `reloadTableData` method, indicating active debugging or fine-tuning of output messages. The final change at 11:38:21 reverted the `console.log` to its initial state, and also included a partial, likely placeholder, addition to the `loadContent` method.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue`**
    *   **25/10/2025, 14:45:05:** This Vue component allows administrators to configure letter templates. It supports creating new letter types or choosing existing ones. Key configurations include letter type, sub-type (for 'NOC'), option for hard copies, letter category, date format, and a new robust request limiting feature. The request limit functionality allows defining a `limit_period`, `request_limit`, and an `limit_exceeded_action`. It integrates with the `CreateLetter` component (likely `wordeditor.vue`) for template content editing and includes options for PDF previews before and after approval.
    *   **25/10/2025, 14:53:13 - 25/10/2025, 14:59:34:** Multiple timestamps in this interval show no functional code changes. This suggests frequent saves or minor, non-functional edits (e.g., whitespace) that were reverted, typical during active development or build processes.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue`**
    *   **25/10/2025, 15:49:52:** This Vue component serves as a central hub for managing various employee requests within the admin dashboard. It dynamically renders specialized components for different request types such as Leave, Lieu, WFH, Passport Safekeep, Loan, Claim, Attendance, Letters, Salary Adjustment, and Salary Advance. A significant update is the comprehensive support for "Letters" requests, where the component passes extensive props to a `LetterRequest` sub-component, including dynamic data for addressee, subject, body, and styling. The component features employee selection, a request history view, a search function, and infinite scrolling for request listings.
    *   **25/10/2025, 15:51:11 - 25/10/2025, 16:20:35:** Similar to `LetterTemplate.vue`, these timestamps indicate no substantive code changes, likely reflecting minor saves or non-functional modifications.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/services/letter_request.service.js`**
    *   **25/10/2025, 16:44:47:** This backend service for letter requests introduces crucial business logic. It now includes a **request limit check** feature, which consults `letterRequestsConfig` to enforce limits on letter creation based on a defined period (e.g., year-to-date or last X days) and a maximum number of requests. If limits are exceeded, it either restricts creation or triggers a notification. The service dynamically resolves approver IDs, de-duplicates them, and adjusts approval requirements. It heavily utilizes `LettersHelper` to assemble letter content, styles, images, and signatory data, populating a wide array of `letter_fields` with user-specific and dynamic data. A new feature explicitly handles "Custom Letter Requests" for overriding standard fields. Critically, it introduces logic for **visa sponsor-specific headers and footers**, dynamically applying configured images and text to letters based on the employee's visa sponsor.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/plugins/general.js`**
    *   **25/10/2025, 16:45:39:** This utility plugin was updated with numerous helper functions. New functionalities include: Excel export capabilities (importing `XLSX` and `file-saver`), converting numbers to words, and a comprehensive set of functions for dynamic styling (colors, borders, images) based on various statuses (e.g., leave, payroll, performance, task, user status) and priorities. It also added `keyNameRegexPayroll` and `keyNameRegex` for formatting display names from internal key formats, `createScale` for generating numerical scales, and specific image/color functions for different leave types.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Front-end (Vue) and Back-end (Node.js) Synchronization:** The changes in `wordeditor.vue`, `LetterTemplate.vue`, `requests.vue` (front-end) and `letter_request.service.js` (back-end) demonstrate a clear pattern of introducing new features (like letter configuration, merge fields, request limits, visa sponsor-specific content) that require coordinated changes across both layers.
*   **Modular Component Design:** The extensive use of child components (`CreateLetter`, `CreateLeaves`, `ClaimRequest`, `LetterRequest`, etc.) in `requests.vue` and `LetterTemplate.vue` indicates a modular and reusable component-based architecture.
*   **Dynamic Data Handling:** There's a strong emphasis on dynamic data fetching, processing, and rendering, from populating merge fields in documents to displaying various request types and user-specific information.
*   **User Interface Enhancement:** Consistent use of Vuetify components for a rich, interactive, and administrative user experience.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The numerous minor `console.log` changes in `wordeditor.vue` highlight an iterative debugging process.
*   **External Library Integration:** Both front-end (`moment`, `XLSX`, `file-saver`, `number-to-words`) and back-end (`lodash`, `moment-timezone`) leverage external libraries for enhanced functionality.
*   **Configuration-Driven Features:** The new request limiting and visa sponsor-specific letter content features are driven by configuration, suggesting flexibility and extensibility in managing system behavior without code changes.
