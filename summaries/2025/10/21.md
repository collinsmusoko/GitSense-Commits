# Activity Summary for 21/10/2025

## 10:30:07
The provided log details changes across two distinct files within the `hecqatar` project, one for the admin frontend and one for the API backend.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps of Changes:** This file was recorded as being updated multiple times between 09:30:25 and 10:09:05 on 21/10/2025.
    *   **Content Analysis:** Across all nine log entries for this file, the content remains absolutely identical. This suggests that the changes recorded were either extremely minor (e.g., whitespace, line endings, or metadata not captured in the diff) or merely repeated saves without any functional code alteration. The file defines a Vue component for an "employment" section within an admin panel, featuring user management (add new user), employee statistics (male/female counts), and an advanced search functionality with filter chips.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-api/src/services/notification.service.js`**
    *   **Timestamps of Changes:** This file also saw multiple recorded updates, specifically between 10:25:11 and 10:26:26 on 21/10/2025.
    *   **Content Analysis:** Similar to the Vue component, the content of this JavaScript service file is identical across all six logged entries. The service provides functions for managing notifications, including retrieving all notifications, fetching notifications for a specific user ID with pagination and sorting, updating notifications, creating new notifications, and marking various types of notifications (general, social posts, social updates) as read for a given user.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Repetitive Saves Without Visible Code Changes:** Both files exhibit a pattern of multiple entries within a short time frame where the code content is exactly the same. This strongly indicates either very minor non-functional edits (like saving without changes or small formatting adjustments) or an issue with how changes are being logged, as no actual code modifications are discernible.
*   **Time Clustering:** All recorded activities occurred on the same date (21/10/2025), with the Vue file updates clustered in a ~40-minute window in the morning, and the Node.js service file updates in a very tight ~1-minute window shortly after.
*   **Application Context:** The files belong to a `hecqatar-admin` (frontend) and `hecqatar-api` (backend) project, indicating work across different layers of the same application.
*   **Vue Component Structure:** The `employment.vue` file uses standard Vue.js and Vuetify components, including `v-card`, `v-card-title`, `v-img`, `v-btn`, `v-text-field`, `v-icon`, `v-tooltip`, and `v-chip`, for building a user interface for employee management.
*   **Node.js Service Structure:** The `notification.service.js` file uses Mongoose (via `Notification` model), MongoDB's `ObjectId`, and a common helper for sort order, defining clear asynchronous functions for CRUD operations and specific "read all" functionalities for notifications.
