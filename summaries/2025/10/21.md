# Activity Summary for 21/10/2025

## 10:30:07
The provided log details changes across two distinct files within the `hecqatar` project, one for the admin frontend and one for the API backend.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps of Changes:** This file was recorded as being updated multiple times between 09:30:25 and 10:09:05 on 21/10/2025.
    *   **Content Analysis:** Across all nine log entries for this file, the content remains absolutely identical. This suggests that the changes recorded were either extremely minor (e.g., whitespace, line endings, or metadata not captured in the diff) or merely repeated saves without any functional code alteration. The file defines a Vue component for an "employment" section within an admin panel, featuring user management (add new user), employee statistics (male/female counts), and an advanced search functionality with filter chips.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-api/src/services/notification.service.js`**
    *   **Timestamps of Changes:** This file also saw multiple recorded updates, specifically between 10:25:11 and 10:26:26 on 21/10/2025.
    *   **Content Analysis:** Similar to the Vue component, the content of this JavaScript service file is identical across all six logged entries. The service provides functions for managing notifications, including retrieving all notifications, fetching notifications for a specific user ID with pagination and sorting, updating notifications, creating new notifications, and marking various types of notifications (general, social posts, social updates) as read for a given user.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Repetitive Saves Without Visible Code Changes:** Both files exhibit a pattern of multiple entries within a short time frame where the code content is exactly the same. This strongly indicates either very minor non-functional edits (like saving without changes or small formatting adjustments) or an issue with how changes are being logged, as no actual code modifications are discernible.
*   **Time Clustering:** All recorded activities occurred on the same date (21/10/2025), with the Vue file updates clustered in a ~40-minute window in the morning, and the Node.js service file updates in a very tight ~1-minute window shortly after.
*   **Application Context:** The files belong to a `hecqatar-admin` (frontend) and `hecqatar-api` (backend) project, indicating work across different layers of the same application.
*   **Vue Component Structure:** The `employment.vue` file uses standard Vue.js and Vuetify components, including `v-card`, `v-card-title`, `v-img`, `v-btn`, `v-text-field`, `v-icon`, `v-tooltip`, and `v-chip`, for building a user interface for employee management.
*   **Node.js Service Structure:** The `notification.service.js` file uses Mongoose (via `Notification` model), MongoDB's `ObjectId`, and a common helper for sort order, defining clear asynchronous functions for CRUD operations and specific "read all" functionalities for notifications.

The project's `package.json` file, last updated on 21/10/2025 at 11:05:34, outlines a Node.js REST API project named "hrdirect".

Key information from the `package.json` includes:

*   **Project Metadata:** The project is version `1.0.0`, described as a "REST API MODEL-CONTROLLER-SERVICES", and authored by Voltaire Biton from NATHAN DIGITAL. It uses a NathanDigital license.
*   **Scripts:** A robust set of scripts is defined:
    *   **Process Management:** `start`, `staging`, and `production` scripts utilize `pm2` with `ecosystem.config.json` for environment-specific deployments. A `shh` script also exists to stop pm2 process 0.
    *   **Development:** `dev` uses `nodemon` for continuous development.
    *   **Testing:** Comprehensive testing scripts include `jest` for unit tests (`test`, `test:watch`, `coverage`) and `coveralls` for coverage reporting.
    *   **Code Quality:** `eslint` is configured for linting (`lint`, `lint:fix`), and `prettier` for code formatting (`prettier`, `prettier:fix`).
    *   **Containerization:** `docker:prod`, `docker:dev`, and `docker:test` scripts are set up for Docker Compose, facilitating environment-specific container deployments.
    *   **Git Hooks:** `prepare` script installs `husky`, indicating pre-commit or pre-push hooks are used for quality checks.
*   **Dependencies:** The project has an extensive list of dependencies, highlighting a feature-rich application.
    *   **Internal Packages:** A significant pattern is the reliance on numerous `@nathangroup` prefixed packages (e.g., `@nathangroup/apm`, `@nathangroup/attendance`, `@nathangroup/claim`, `@nathangroup/leave`, `@nathangroup/payroll`, `@nathangroup/ssomatrix`, `@nathangroup/wfh`, and their corresponding email modules), suggesting an internal ecosystem.
    *   **Core Technologies:** It uses `express` for the web framework, `mongoose` and `mongodb` for database interaction, and `jsonwebtoken` with `passport` for authentication.
    *   **Cloud Services:** Integrations with AWS S3 (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `aws-sdk`), Azure MSAL (`@azure/msal-node`), Firebase (`firebase-admin`), and Google APIs (`google-auth-library`, `googleapis`) are present.
    *   **Utility & Features:** Includes dependencies for email (`@sendgrid/mail`, `nodemailer`), file uploads (`express-fileupload`, `multer`, `multer-s3`), PDF generation/parsing (`pdf-creator-node`, `pdf-img-convert`, `pdf-parse`, `pdfkit`, `pdfmake`), Excel (`exceljs`, `xlsx`), image processing (`sharp`, `canvas`), real-time communication (`socket.io`), caching (`ioredis`, `lru-cache`), scheduling (`node-cron`), and various security measures (`helmet`, `xss-clean`, `express-mongo-sanitize`, `express-rate-limit`).
*   **Dev Dependencies:** Development tools include `jest`, `supertest`, `node-mocks-http` for testing, `eslint` and `prettier` for code quality, `husky` and `lint-staged` for pre-commit hooks, and `nodemon` for development server management.
*   **Overrides:** `puppeteer` is overridden to version `^22.8.2`.
*   **Volta:** The project specifies Node.js version `14.18.3` using Volta.
