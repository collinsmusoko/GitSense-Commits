# Activity Summary for 23/10/2025

## 09:27:49
The provided log details changes to a Vue component, `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`, across two different project paths: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/` and `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**:
    *   Across the timestamps 23/10/2025, 08:42:32, 08:43:05, 08:43:44, and 08:46:03, the content of this file remained **unchanged**. The entries consistently show a Vue component for managing email notification templates. It includes a data table for listing templates, dialogs for adding/editing and viewing templates, and an edit warning dialog with a countdown. The template form supports fields like title, category, subcategory, description, recipients (To, CC, BCC), subject, and body (using an EJS Rich Text Editor). It also defines a comprehensive list of email categories and subcategories covering Leave, Letter, Claim, WFH, Attendance, Personal Document Expiry, Company Document Expiry, and Employee Engagement.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**:
    *   This file also manages email notification templates with the same UI and functionality as the `binhendi-admin` version.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:47:50**: Initial state for this project path, functionally similar to the `binhendi-admin` version, but with the `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel button explicitly closing the dialog (`@click="addNewTemplateDialog = false"`). The `data()` properties `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` were not explicitly initialized as empty arrays here.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:48:53**: A functional change was introduced in the `addNewTemplateDialog` where the cancel button's click handler was updated from directly closing the dialog to calling a `cancelEdit` method (`@click="cancelEdit"`).
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:49:54**: This entry appears to **revert** the `addNewTemplateDialog` cancel button change back to `@click="addNewTemplateDialog = false"`. However, it **adds** the initialization of `ccOptions:[]` and `bccOptions:[]` to the component's data properties.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:50:36**: The `addNewTemplateDialog` cancel button change is **re-applied**, reverting to `@click="cancelEdit"`. The `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data initializations are retained.
    *   **Timestamps 23/10/2025, 08:56:35, 08:57:53, 08:59:23**: The content across these timestamps for this file remained **unchanged** from the state at 08:50:36.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **23/10/2025, 08:48:53**: Introduction of `cancelEdit` method for `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel action in the `binhendi-mcs-admin` project.
*   **23/10/2025, 08:49:54**: Addition of `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data properties and a temporary revert of the cancel button logic in `binhendi-mcs-admin`.
*   **23/10/2025, 08:50:36**: Re-application of the `cancelEdit` method for the cancel button and persistence of `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data properties in `binhendi-mcs-admin`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Code Duplication/Reuse:** The `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component is essentially identical in its structure and core functionality across both `/binhendi-admin` and `/binhendi-mcs-admin` project paths, suggesting a common component or a copy-paste practice.
*   **Syncfusion Rich Text Editor:** Both files consistently utilize `@syncfusion/ej2-vue-richtexteditor` for the email body input, including the registration of a Syncfusion license key. The license key itself is a long string that appears identically in every logged entry.
*   **Standardized Email Categories:** The `categoryClassifications` data structure, defining email types for "Leave", "Letter", "Claim", "WFH", "Attendance", "Personal Document Expiry", "Company Document Expiry", and "Employee Engagement", is identical across all logged versions of the file, indicating a shared business logic or configuration.
*   **Vuetify Components:** The reliance on Vuetify (`v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-dialog`, `v-select`, etc.) for UI elements is a consistent pattern.
*   **Interactive Dialogs:** The use of multiple `v-dialog` components for "Add/Edit", "View", and "Edit Warning" functionality is a repeating structural pattern.
*   **Minor Iterative Fixes:** The changes in `binhendi-mcs-admin` regarding the `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel button handler and the explicit declaration of `ccOptions`/`bccOptions` suggest small, iterative adjustments or corrections to component behavior and data initialization.
