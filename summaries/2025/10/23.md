# Activity Summary for 23/10/2025

## 09:27:49
The provided log details changes to a Vue component, `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`, across two different project paths: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/` and `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**:
    *   Across the timestamps 23/10/2025, 08:42:32, 08:43:05, 08:43:44, and 08:46:03, the content of this file remained **unchanged**. The entries consistently show a Vue component for managing email notification templates. It includes a data table for listing templates, dialogs for adding/editing and viewing templates, and an edit warning dialog with a countdown. The template form supports fields like title, category, subcategory, description, recipients (To, CC, BCC), subject, and body (using an EJS Rich Text Editor). It also defines a comprehensive list of email categories and subcategories covering Leave, Letter, Claim, WFH, Attendance, Personal Document Expiry, Company Document Expiry, and Employee Engagement.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**:
    *   This file also manages email notification templates with the same UI and functionality as the `binhendi-admin` version.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:47:50**: Initial state for this project path, functionally similar to the `binhendi-admin` version, but with the `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel button explicitly closing the dialog (`@click="addNewTemplateDialog = false"`). The `data()` properties `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` were not explicitly initialized as empty arrays here.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:48:53**: A functional change was introduced in the `addNewTemplateDialog` where the cancel button's click handler was updated from directly closing the dialog to calling a `cancelEdit` method (`@click="cancelEdit"`).
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:49:54**: This entry appears to **revert** the `addNewTemplateDialog` cancel button change back to `@click="addNewTemplateDialog = false"`. However, it **adds** the initialization of `ccOptions:[]` and `bccOptions:[]` to the component's data properties.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:50:36**: The `addNewTemplateDialog` cancel button change is **re-applied**, reverting to `@click="cancelEdit"`. The `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data initializations are retained.
    *   **Timestamps 23/10/2025, 08:56:35, 08:57:53, 08:59:23**: The content across these timestamps for this file remained **unchanged** from the state at 08:50:36.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **23/10/2025, 08:48:53**: Introduction of `cancelEdit` method for `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel action in the `binhendi-mcs-admin` project.
*   **23/10/2025, 08:49:54**: Addition of `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data properties and a temporary revert of the cancel button logic in `binhendi-mcs-admin`.
*   **23/10/2025, 08:50:36**: Re-application of the `cancelEdit` method for the cancel button and persistence of `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data properties in `binhendi-mcs-admin`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Code Duplication/Reuse:** The `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component is essentially identical in its structure and core functionality across both `/binhendi-admin` and `/binhendi-mcs-admin` project paths, suggesting a common component or a copy-paste practice.
*   **Syncfusion Rich Text Editor:** Both files consistently utilize `@syncfusion/ej2-vue-richtexteditor` for the email body input, including the registration of a Syncfusion license key. The license key itself is a long string that appears identically in every logged entry.
*   **Standardized Email Categories:** The `categoryClassifications` data structure, defining email types for "Leave", "Letter", "Claim", "WFH", "Attendance", "Personal Document Expiry", "Company Document Expiry", and "Employee Engagement", is identical across all logged versions of the file, indicating a shared business logic or configuration.
*   **Vuetify Components:** The reliance on Vuetify (`v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-dialog`, `v-select`, etc.) for UI elements is a consistent pattern.
*   **Interactive Dialogs:** The use of multiple `v-dialog` components for "Add/Edit", "View", and "Edit Warning" functionality is a repeating structural pattern.
*   **Minor Iterative Fixes:** The changes in `binhendi-mcs-admin` regarding the `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel button handler and the explicit declaration of `ccOptions`/`bccOptions` suggest small, iterative adjustments or corrections to component behavior and data initialization.

## 10:27:54
The provided log details changes to the `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component across two different projects: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin` and `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file was logged four times between 23/10/2025, 08:42:32 and 23/10/2025, 08:46:03.
    *   **Changes:** Within the provided snippets, no discernible code changes were observed across these entries. The content remained identical, indicating either no modifications, or changes that were outside the truncated log, or rapid reverts.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** This file saw multiple updates between 23/10/2025, 08:47:50 and 23/10/2025, 08:59:23.
    *   **Key Changes at 08:47:50:**
        *   The "Cancel" action for the `addNewTemplateDialog` was modified to directly close the dialog (`addNewTemplateDialog = false`) instead of calling the `cancelEdit` method.
        *   Several data properties related to the `editWarningDialog` (e.g., `isEditing`, `editingIndex`, `editingTemplate`, `countdown`, `countdownInterval`) were removed, suggesting an attempt to streamline or remove specific editing state management.
        *   A specific subcategory value within `categoryClassifications` for 'Claim' -> 'Request Email (Approver)' was updated from `claim_request_email_approver` to `claim_request_new_approver`.
        *   The 'Employee Engagement' category was expanded to include new subcategories: 'New Joiner' and 'Exit'.
        *   An empty `toOptions:[]` array was added to the component's data.
    *   **Key Changes at 08:48:53 (Partial Revert and Addition):**
        *   The "Cancel" action for the `addNewTemplateDialog` was **reverted** to call the `cancelEdit` method, undoing the previous change.
        *   The `editWarningDialog` and its associated data properties (removed in the prior timestamp) were **re-introduced**, indicating a revert of that specific refactoring attempt.
        *   New empty array properties `ccOptions:[]` and `bccOptions:[]` were added to the component's data.
        *   The updates to `categoryClassifications` (claim subcategory and new employee engagement subcategories) introduced at 08:47:50 **persisted**.
    *   **Further entries (08:49:54, 08:50:36, 08:56:35, 08:57:53, 08:59:23):** No additional changes were observed in the provided snippets for these later timestamps; the content remained consistent with the state at 08:48:53.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component Duplication/Reuse:** The `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component exists in seemingly identical forms in two different admin project paths (`binhendi-admin` and `binhendi-mcs-admin`), suggesting component reuse or duplication across projects.
*   **Email Template Management Focus:** The component is entirely dedicated to managing email notification templates, including defining their title, category, subcategory, recipients (To, CC, BCC), subject, and body.
*   **UI Frameworks:** The component extensively uses Vuetify (`v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-dialog`, `v-btn`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-textarea`, `v-icon`) for its user interface.
*   **Rich Text Editor Integration:** It integrates `ejs-richtexteditor` from Syncfusion for composing email bodies, indicated by the `ejs-richtexteditor` component and its associated `registerLicense` call.
*   **Dynamic Categories:** The component defines a comprehensive list of `categoryClassifications` for email templates, covering various HR-related workflows such as Leave, Letter, Claim, WFH, Attendance, Personal Document Expiry, Company Document Expiry, and Employee Engagement. This list is dynamically used in `v-select` components.
*   **Dialog-based Interactions:** Key functionalities like adding new templates, viewing existing ones, and showing edit warnings are managed through `v-dialog` components.
*   **Syncfusion License:** A Syncfusion license key is consistently present at the beginning of the script section in all log entries, indicating the use of commercial UI components.
*   **Frequent Iteration/Reversion:** The changes in `binhendi-mcs-admin` show a pattern of modifications followed by quick reverts or further refinements, particularly around dialog management and state properties, suggesting an active development or debugging phase.

## 11:54:13
The logs show a series of updates primarily focused on two Vue.js components related to HR functionalities: `LetterTemplate.vue` for letter configuration and `requests.vue` for self-service requests, across two different project paths: `binhendi-mcs-admin` and `binhendi-admin`. A new JavaScript utility for pronoun handling was also introduced.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp (Consistent):** `23/10/2025, 11:08:00`, `11:12:16`, `11:12:35`, `11:13:15`, `11:13:25`
    *   This component provides a comprehensive interface for managing letter templates. It includes tabs for "CREATE NEW LETTER," "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER," and "Letter Key Hints." Users can configure various aspects of a letter request, such as:
        *   Defining letter type and subtype, with uniqueness validation.
        *   Options to allow hard copies, choose letter categories (multiple), and select date formats.
        *   A feature to display letters in the "Team Calendar" with a hint for `[fromDate]` and `[toDate]` placeholders.
        *   Functionality to limit the number of requests, specifying a `limit_period`, `request_limit`, and `limit_exceeded_action`.
        *   Buttons for PDF preview and "Before Approve Preview" which utilize a `CreateLetter` component for editing document content.
        *   A delete option for existing letter templates.
    *   Multiple log entries for this file show identical content, suggesting either repeated saves without material changes or a version control artifact.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp (Consistent):** `23/10/2025, 11:08:05`, `11:24:08`, `11:24:20`
    *   This component handles a range of HR self-service requests for the `binhendi-admin` project.
    *   Users can select various request types (e.g., Leaves, Loan, Education, WFH, Claim, Letters, Passport Release) using a dropdown.
    *   A claim request tooltip provides specific guidelines, including that receipts are compulsory and file size should not exceed "2MB."
    *   The component displays a list of "All Requests" or "All Pending Requests" with a scroll-based loading mechanism.
    *   A "Team Calendar" is available specifically for leave and WFH requests, allowing navigation (prev/next month) and displaying event details (leave type, start/end dates).
    *   A "Letter Preview" section renders the content of selected letter requests.
    *   The content across these three timestamps is identical, indicating a stable version within this project path.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp (Significant Change):** `23/10/2025, 11:13:46`
    *   This entry introduces significant enhancements to the HR self-service requests component within the `binhendi-mcs-admin` project.
    *   **Key updates include:**
        *   **Increased Claim Attachment Limit:** The maximum receipt file size for claim requests was increased from "2MB" to "10MB."
        *   **New Request Types:** Added support for `Salary Advance`, `CreateTimeOffLieu`, and `CreateTripRequest` components, expanding the range of self-service options.
        *   **Enhanced LetterRequest Props:** The `LetterRequest` component now receives additional props like `referenceNumber`, `canRequestHardCopy`, and `selectedEmp`, suggesting richer integration or data handling for letters.
        *   **Flexible Team Calendar:** The Team Calendar logic was updated to be more dynamic (`(showInTeamCalendar || requestType?.toLowerCase().includes('leave'))`), enabling its display for more request types, including letters, not just leaves. The event display within the calendar menu also dynamically shows "Letter Type" or "Leave Type."
        *   A minor UI enhancement added the `eager` prop to an image element.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/test-pronouns.js`**
    *   **Timestamp (New Feature):** `23/10/2025, 11:23:34`
    *   This new JavaScript file introduces a utility function `replaceContextAwarePronoun`.
    *   The function is designed to handle gender-specific pronoun replacements (e.g., `[Him/Her]`, `[His/Her]`, `[He/She]`) based on a provided gender (`male` or `female`).
    *   It intelligently capitalizes the pronoun when it appears at the beginning of a sentence, even if preceded by whitespace, punctuation, numbers, or list markers.
    *   The script includes self-contained test cases to verify the functionality, demonstrating its context-aware capitalization. This suggests a focus on improving the personalization and grammatical correctness of dynamically generated text, likely within letters or notifications.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **23/10/2025, 11:13:46:** This timestamp marks a substantial update to the `binhendi-mcs-admin/requests.vue` component, adding new functionalities and improving existing ones.
*   **23/10/2025, 11:23:34:** The introduction of `test-pronouns.js` signifies a new development effort towards context-aware text processing.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue.js and Vuetify:** All UI-related files are Vue components heavily leveraging the Vuetify framework for design and functionality.
*   **Request-Driven System:** A core pattern is the handling of various types of user requests within the HR self-service module, from leaves and loans to letter generation.
*   **Administrative vs. User Interfaces:** The existence of similar `requests.vue` components in `binhendi-admin` and `binhendi-mcs-admin` suggests a separation of concerns, with `binhendi-mcs-admin` often receiving more advanced features or higher limits (e.g., 10MB vs 2MB attachment limit).
*   **Dynamic Document Generation:** The `LetterTemplate.vue` component and the new `test-pronouns.js` utility point to a strong emphasis on dynamic, configurable, and grammatically correct document and letter generation within the system.
*   **Calendar Integration:** The "Team Calendar" feature is a recurring element in self-service requests for visualizing time-based requests.
*   **Code Duplication/Stability:** The identical content across multiple timestamps for `LetterTemplate.vue` and `binhendi-admin/requests.vue` indicates periods of either no changes or very stable code, contrasted with the significant functional updates seen in `binhendi-mcs-admin/requests.vue`.

## 12:54:18

    *   **23/10/2025, 11:08:00**: A comprehensive letter template configuration interface was introduced. This component now supports creating new letter types and managing existing ones through a tabbed interface. Features include:
        *   Defining letter type, subtype (specifically for 'NOC'), category, and date format.
        *   Toggles for allowing hard copies, displaying letters in a "Team Calendar," and setting request limits (period, request count, and action for exceeding the limit).
        *   Functionality to preview PDF versions of letters (both current and "before approval"), delete templates, and save updates.
        *   The code was repeatedly committed without functional changes at **11:12:16, 11:12:35, 11:13:15**.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:08:05**: This component, part of the `binhendi-admin` project, handles various HR self-service requests. It conditionally renders specific sub-components for request types such as Leave, Loan, Education, WFH, Claims, Letters, and Passport Release. At this point, the instructions for claim requests specified a maximum receipt file size of **2MB**.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:13:46**: This version, from the `binhendi-mcs-admin` project, received significant enhancements:
        *   The maximum receipt file size for claim requests was increased from **2MB to 10MB**.
        *   Support for new request types was added: "Salary Advance" (`CreateSalaryAdvance`), "Time Off Lieu" (`CreateTimeOffLieu`), and "Trip Request" (`CreateTripRequest`).
        *   The `LetterRequest` component was updated to accept new `referenceNumber` and `canRequestHardCopy` props.
        *   The Team Calendar logic was expanded to include `showInTeamCalendar`, allowing letters to be displayed on the calendar, with the calendar event details dynamically showing "Letter" or "Leave" type.
        *   Minor styling addition: `eager` prop added to a `v-img` component.
        *   The code was repeatedly committed without functional changes at **11:15:08, 11:15:28**.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/test-pronouns.js`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:23:34**: A new JavaScript file was added. This script implements and tests a `replaceContextAwarePronoun` function. It dynamically replaces placeholders like `[Him/Her]` with the correct male or female pronoun, capitalizing it if the pronoun appears at the beginning of a sentence. This suggests a new feature for context-aware, dynamic text generation, likely for document or notification content.

5.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:24:08**: This entry for the `binhendi-admin` project shows an older state compared to the `binhendi-mcs-admin` project. The claim receipt limit is back to **2MB**, and none of the new request types or calendar enhancements introduced in `binhendi-mcs-admin` are present. This indicates either a divergence of the two projects or a temporary rollback in `binhendi-admin`.
    *   The code was committed again without functional changes at **11:24:20**.

6.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/document-editor/wordeditor.vue`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 12:52:55**: A new Vue component was introduced to provide a rich document editing experience using Syncfusion's Document Editor. Key functionalities include:
