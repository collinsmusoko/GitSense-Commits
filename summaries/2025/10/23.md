# Activity Summary for 23/10/2025

## 09:27:49
The provided log details changes to a Vue component, `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`, across two different project paths: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/` and `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**:
    *   Across the timestamps 23/10/2025, 08:42:32, 08:43:05, 08:43:44, and 08:46:03, the content of this file remained **unchanged**. The entries consistently show a Vue component for managing email notification templates. It includes a data table for listing templates, dialogs for adding/editing and viewing templates, and an edit warning dialog with a countdown. The template form supports fields like title, category, subcategory, description, recipients (To, CC, BCC), subject, and body (using an EJS Rich Text Editor). It also defines a comprehensive list of email categories and subcategories covering Leave, Letter, Claim, WFH, Attendance, Personal Document Expiry, Company Document Expiry, and Employee Engagement.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**:
    *   This file also manages email notification templates with the same UI and functionality as the `binhendi-admin` version.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:47:50**: Initial state for this project path, functionally similar to the `binhendi-admin` version, but with the `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel button explicitly closing the dialog (`@click="addNewTemplateDialog = false"`). The `data()` properties `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` were not explicitly initialized as empty arrays here.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:48:53**: A functional change was introduced in the `addNewTemplateDialog` where the cancel button's click handler was updated from directly closing the dialog to calling a `cancelEdit` method (`@click="cancelEdit"`).
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:49:54**: This entry appears to **revert** the `addNewTemplateDialog` cancel button change back to `@click="addNewTemplateDialog = false"`. However, it **adds** the initialization of `ccOptions:[]` and `bccOptions:[]` to the component's data properties.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:50:36**: The `addNewTemplateDialog` cancel button change is **re-applied**, reverting to `@click="cancelEdit"`. The `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data initializations are retained.
    *   **Timestamps 23/10/2025, 08:56:35, 08:57:53, 08:59:23**: The content across these timestamps for this file remained **unchanged** from the state at 08:50:36.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **23/10/2025, 08:48:53**: Introduction of `cancelEdit` method for `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel action in the `binhendi-mcs-admin` project.
*   **23/10/2025, 08:49:54**: Addition of `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data properties and a temporary revert of the cancel button logic in `binhendi-mcs-admin`.
*   **23/10/2025, 08:50:36**: Re-application of the `cancelEdit` method for the cancel button and persistence of `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data properties in `binhendi-mcs-admin`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Code Duplication/Reuse:** The `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component is essentially identical in its structure and core functionality across both `/binhendi-admin` and `/binhendi-mcs-admin` project paths, suggesting a common component or a copy-paste practice.
*   **Syncfusion Rich Text Editor:** Both files consistently utilize `@syncfusion/ej2-vue-richtexteditor` for the email body input, including the registration of a Syncfusion license key. The license key itself is a long string that appears identically in every logged entry.
*   **Standardized Email Categories:** The `categoryClassifications` data structure, defining email types for "Leave", "Letter", "Claim", "WFH", "Attendance", "Personal Document Expiry", "Company Document Expiry", and "Employee Engagement", is identical across all logged versions of the file, indicating a shared business logic or configuration.
*   **Vuetify Components:** The reliance on Vuetify (`v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-dialog`, `v-select`, etc.) for UI elements is a consistent pattern.
*   **Interactive Dialogs:** The use of multiple `v-dialog` components for "Add/Edit", "View", and "Edit Warning" functionality is a repeating structural pattern.
*   **Minor Iterative Fixes:** The changes in `binhendi-mcs-admin` regarding the `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel button handler and the explicit declaration of `ccOptions`/`bccOptions` suggest small, iterative adjustments or corrections to component behavior and data initialization.

## 10:27:54
The provided log details changes to the `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component across two different projects: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin` and `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file was logged four times between 23/10/2025, 08:42:32 and 23/10/2025, 08:46:03.
    *   **Changes:** Within the provided snippets, no discernible code changes were observed across these entries. The content remained identical, indicating either no modifications, or changes that were outside the truncated log, or rapid reverts.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** This file saw multiple updates between 23/10/2025, 08:47:50 and 23/10/2025, 08:59:23.
    *   **Key Changes at 08:47:50:**
        *   The "Cancel" action for the `addNewTemplateDialog` was modified to directly close the dialog (`addNewTemplateDialog = false`) instead of calling the `cancelEdit` method.
        *   Several data properties related to the `editWarningDialog` (e.g., `isEditing`, `editingIndex`, `editingTemplate`, `countdown`, `countdownInterval`) were removed, suggesting an attempt to streamline or remove specific editing state management.
        *   A specific subcategory value within `categoryClassifications` for 'Claim' -> 'Request Email (Approver)' was updated from `claim_request_email_approver` to `claim_request_new_approver`.
        *   The 'Employee Engagement' category was expanded to include new subcategories: 'New Joiner' and 'Exit'.
        *   An empty `toOptions:[]` array was added to the component's data.
    *   **Key Changes at 08:48:53 (Partial Revert and Addition):**
        *   The "Cancel" action for the `addNewTemplateDialog` was **reverted** to call the `cancelEdit` method, undoing the previous change.
        *   The `editWarningDialog` and its associated data properties (removed in the prior timestamp) were **re-introduced**, indicating a revert of that specific refactoring attempt.
        *   New empty array properties `ccOptions:[]` and `bccOptions:[]` were added to the component's data.
        *   The updates to `categoryClassifications` (claim subcategory and new employee engagement subcategories) introduced at 08:47:50 **persisted**.
    *   **Further entries (08:49:54, 08:50:36, 08:56:35, 08:57:53, 08:59:23):** No additional changes were observed in the provided snippets for these later timestamps; the content remained consistent with the state at 08:48:53.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component Duplication/Reuse:** The `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component exists in seemingly identical forms in two different admin project paths (`binhendi-admin` and `binhendi-mcs-admin`), suggesting component reuse or duplication across projects.
*   **Email Template Management Focus:** The component is entirely dedicated to managing email notification templates, including defining their title, category, subcategory, recipients (To, CC, BCC), subject, and body.
*   **UI Frameworks:** The component extensively uses Vuetify (`v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-dialog`, `v-btn`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-textarea`, `v-icon`) for its user interface.
*   **Rich Text Editor Integration:** It integrates `ejs-richtexteditor` from Syncfusion for composing email bodies, indicated by the `ejs-richtexteditor` component and its associated `registerLicense` call.
*   **Dynamic Categories:** The component defines a comprehensive list of `categoryClassifications` for email templates, covering various HR-related workflows such as Leave, Letter, Claim, WFH, Attendance, Personal Document Expiry, Company Document Expiry, and Employee Engagement. This list is dynamically used in `v-select` components.
*   **Dialog-based Interactions:** Key functionalities like adding new templates, viewing existing ones, and showing edit warnings are managed through `v-dialog` components.
*   **Syncfusion License:** A Syncfusion license key is consistently present at the beginning of the script section in all log entries, indicating the use of commercial UI components.
*   **Frequent Iteration/Reversion:** The changes in `binhendi-mcs-admin` show a pattern of modifications followed by quick reverts or further refinements, particularly around dialog management and state properties, suggesting an active development or debugging phase.
