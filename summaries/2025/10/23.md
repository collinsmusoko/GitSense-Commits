# Activity Summary for 23/10/2025

## 09:27:49
The provided log details changes to a Vue component, `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`, across two different project paths: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/` and `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**:
    *   Across the timestamps 23/10/2025, 08:42:32, 08:43:05, 08:43:44, and 08:46:03, the content of this file remained **unchanged**. The entries consistently show a Vue component for managing email notification templates. It includes a data table for listing templates, dialogs for adding/editing and viewing templates, and an edit warning dialog with a countdown. The template form supports fields like title, category, subcategory, description, recipients (To, CC, BCC), subject, and body (using an EJS Rich Text Editor). It also defines a comprehensive list of email categories and subcategories covering Leave, Letter, Claim, WFH, Attendance, Personal Document Expiry, Company Document Expiry, and Employee Engagement.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**:
    *   This file also manages email notification templates with the same UI and functionality as the `binhendi-admin` version.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:47:50**: Initial state for this project path, functionally similar to the `binhendi-admin` version, but with the `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel button explicitly closing the dialog (`@click="addNewTemplateDialog = false"`). The `data()` properties `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` were not explicitly initialized as empty arrays here.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:48:53**: A functional change was introduced in the `addNewTemplateDialog` where the cancel button's click handler was updated from directly closing the dialog to calling a `cancelEdit` method (`@click="cancelEdit"`).
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:49:54**: This entry appears to **revert** the `addNewTemplateDialog` cancel button change back to `@click="addNewTemplateDialog = false"`. However, it **adds** the initialization of `ccOptions:[]` and `bccOptions:[]` to the component's data properties.
    *   **Timestamp 23/10/2025, 08:50:36**: The `addNewTemplateDialog` cancel button change is **re-applied**, reverting to `@click="cancelEdit"`. The `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data initializations are retained.
    *   **Timestamps 23/10/2025, 08:56:35, 08:57:53, 08:59:23**: The content across these timestamps for this file remained **unchanged** from the state at 08:50:36.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **23/10/2025, 08:48:53**: Introduction of `cancelEdit` method for `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel action in the `binhendi-mcs-admin` project.
*   **23/10/2025, 08:49:54**: Addition of `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data properties and a temporary revert of the cancel button logic in `binhendi-mcs-admin`.
*   **23/10/2025, 08:50:36**: Re-application of the `cancelEdit` method for the cancel button and persistence of `ccOptions` and `bccOptions` data properties in `binhendi-mcs-admin`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Code Duplication/Reuse:** The `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component is essentially identical in its structure and core functionality across both `/binhendi-admin` and `/binhendi-mcs-admin` project paths, suggesting a common component or a copy-paste practice.
*   **Syncfusion Rich Text Editor:** Both files consistently utilize `@syncfusion/ej2-vue-richtexteditor` for the email body input, including the registration of a Syncfusion license key. The license key itself is a long string that appears identically in every logged entry.
*   **Standardized Email Categories:** The `categoryClassifications` data structure, defining email types for "Leave", "Letter", "Claim", "WFH", "Attendance", "Personal Document Expiry", "Company Document Expiry", and "Employee Engagement", is identical across all logged versions of the file, indicating a shared business logic or configuration.
*   **Vuetify Components:** The reliance on Vuetify (`v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-dialog`, `v-select`, etc.) for UI elements is a consistent pattern.
*   **Interactive Dialogs:** The use of multiple `v-dialog` components for "Add/Edit", "View", and "Edit Warning" functionality is a repeating structural pattern.
*   **Minor Iterative Fixes:** The changes in `binhendi-mcs-admin` regarding the `addNewTemplateDialog`'s cancel button handler and the explicit declaration of `ccOptions`/`bccOptions` suggest small, iterative adjustments or corrections to component behavior and data initialization.

## 10:27:54
The provided log details changes to the `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component across two different projects: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin` and `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file was logged four times between 23/10/2025, 08:42:32 and 23/10/2025, 08:46:03.
    *   **Changes:** Within the provided snippets, no discernible code changes were observed across these entries. The content remained identical, indicating either no modifications, or changes that were outside the truncated log, or rapid reverts.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** This file saw multiple updates between 23/10/2025, 08:47:50 and 23/10/2025, 08:59:23.
    *   **Key Changes at 08:47:50:**
        *   The "Cancel" action for the `addNewTemplateDialog` was modified to directly close the dialog (`addNewTemplateDialog = false`) instead of calling the `cancelEdit` method.
        *   Several data properties related to the `editWarningDialog` (e.g., `isEditing`, `editingIndex`, `editingTemplate`, `countdown`, `countdownInterval`) were removed, suggesting an attempt to streamline or remove specific editing state management.
        *   A specific subcategory value within `categoryClassifications` for 'Claim' -> 'Request Email (Approver)' was updated from `claim_request_email_approver` to `claim_request_new_approver`.
        *   The 'Employee Engagement' category was expanded to include new subcategories: 'New Joiner' and 'Exit'.
        *   An empty `toOptions:[]` array was added to the component's data.
    *   **Key Changes at 08:48:53 (Partial Revert and Addition):**
        *   The "Cancel" action for the `addNewTemplateDialog` was **reverted** to call the `cancelEdit` method, undoing the previous change.
        *   The `editWarningDialog` and its associated data properties (removed in the prior timestamp) were **re-introduced**, indicating a revert of that specific refactoring attempt.
        *   New empty array properties `ccOptions:[]` and `bccOptions:[]` were added to the component's data.
        *   The updates to `categoryClassifications` (claim subcategory and new employee engagement subcategories) introduced at 08:47:50 **persisted**.
    *   **Further entries (08:49:54, 08:50:36, 08:56:35, 08:57:53, 08:59:23):** No additional changes were observed in the provided snippets for these later timestamps; the content remained consistent with the state at 08:48:53.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component Duplication/Reuse:** The `EmailTemplatesConfigurator.vue` component exists in seemingly identical forms in two different admin project paths (`binhendi-admin` and `binhendi-mcs-admin`), suggesting component reuse or duplication across projects.
*   **Email Template Management Focus:** The component is entirely dedicated to managing email notification templates, including defining their title, category, subcategory, recipients (To, CC, BCC), subject, and body.
*   **UI Frameworks:** The component extensively uses Vuetify (`v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-dialog`, `v-btn`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-textarea`, `v-icon`) for its user interface.
*   **Rich Text Editor Integration:** It integrates `ejs-richtexteditor` from Syncfusion for composing email bodies, indicated by the `ejs-richtexteditor` component and its associated `registerLicense` call.
*   **Dynamic Categories:** The component defines a comprehensive list of `categoryClassifications` for email templates, covering various HR-related workflows such as Leave, Letter, Claim, WFH, Attendance, Personal Document Expiry, Company Document Expiry, and Employee Engagement. This list is dynamically used in `v-select` components.
*   **Dialog-based Interactions:** Key functionalities like adding new templates, viewing existing ones, and showing edit warnings are managed through `v-dialog` components.
*   **Syncfusion License:** A Syncfusion license key is consistently present at the beginning of the script section in all log entries, indicating the use of commercial UI components.
*   **Frequent Iteration/Reversion:** The changes in `binhendi-mcs-admin` show a pattern of modifications followed by quick reverts or further refinements, particularly around dialog management and state properties, suggesting an active development or debugging phase.

## 11:54:13
The logs show a series of updates primarily focused on two Vue.js components related to HR functionalities: `LetterTemplate.vue` for letter configuration and `requests.vue` for self-service requests, across two different project paths: `binhendi-mcs-admin` and `binhendi-admin`. A new JavaScript utility for pronoun handling was also introduced.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp (Consistent):** `23/10/2025, 11:08:00`, `11:12:16`, `11:12:35`, `11:13:15`, `11:13:25`
    *   This component provides a comprehensive interface for managing letter templates. It includes tabs for "CREATE NEW LETTER," "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER," and "Letter Key Hints." Users can configure various aspects of a letter request, such as:
        *   Defining letter type and subtype, with uniqueness validation.
        *   Options to allow hard copies, choose letter categories (multiple), and select date formats.
        *   A feature to display letters in the "Team Calendar" with a hint for `[fromDate]` and `[toDate]` placeholders.
        *   Functionality to limit the number of requests, specifying a `limit_period`, `request_limit`, and `limit_exceeded_action`.
        *   Buttons for PDF preview and "Before Approve Preview" which utilize a `CreateLetter` component for editing document content.
        *   A delete option for existing letter templates.
    *   Multiple log entries for this file show identical content, suggesting either repeated saves without material changes or a version control artifact.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp (Consistent):** `23/10/2025, 11:08:05`, `11:24:08`, `11:24:20`
    *   This component handles a range of HR self-service requests for the `binhendi-admin` project.
    *   Users can select various request types (e.g., Leaves, Loan, Education, WFH, Claim, Letters, Passport Release) using a dropdown.
    *   A claim request tooltip provides specific guidelines, including that receipts are compulsory and file size should not exceed "2MB."
    *   The component displays a list of "All Requests" or "All Pending Requests" with a scroll-based loading mechanism.
    *   A "Team Calendar" is available specifically for leave and WFH requests, allowing navigation (prev/next month) and displaying event details (leave type, start/end dates).
    *   A "Letter Preview" section renders the content of selected letter requests.
    *   The content across these three timestamps is identical, indicating a stable version within this project path.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp (Significant Change):** `23/10/2025, 11:13:46`
    *   This entry introduces significant enhancements to the HR self-service requests component within the `binhendi-mcs-admin` project.
    *   **Key updates include:**
        *   **Increased Claim Attachment Limit:** The maximum receipt file size for claim requests was increased from "2MB" to "10MB."
        *   **New Request Types:** Added support for `Salary Advance`, `CreateTimeOffLieu`, and `CreateTripRequest` components, expanding the range of self-service options.
        *   **Enhanced LetterRequest Props:** The `LetterRequest` component now receives additional props like `referenceNumber`, `canRequestHardCopy`, and `selectedEmp`, suggesting richer integration or data handling for letters.
        *   **Flexible Team Calendar:** The Team Calendar logic was updated to be more dynamic (`(showInTeamCalendar || requestType?.toLowerCase().includes('leave'))`), enabling its display for more request types, including letters, not just leaves. The event display within the calendar menu also dynamically shows "Letter Type" or "Leave Type."
        *   A minor UI enhancement added the `eager` prop to an image element.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/test-pronouns.js`**
    *   **Timestamp (New Feature):** `23/10/2025, 11:23:34`
    *   This new JavaScript file introduces a utility function `replaceContextAwarePronoun`.
    *   The function is designed to handle gender-specific pronoun replacements (e.g., `[Him/Her]`, `[His/Her]`, `[He/She]`) based on a provided gender (`male` or `female`).
    *   It intelligently capitalizes the pronoun when it appears at the beginning of a sentence, even if preceded by whitespace, punctuation, numbers, or list markers.
    *   The script includes self-contained test cases to verify the functionality, demonstrating its context-aware capitalization. This suggests a focus on improving the personalization and grammatical correctness of dynamically generated text, likely within letters or notifications.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

## 13:54:18
`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue` (Multiple entries: 23/10/2025, 11:08:00, 11:12:16, 11:12:35, 11:13:15, 11:13:25, 13:20:39, 13:21:27, 13:21:48, 13:22:09)
This Vue component is designed for configuring and managing letter templates within an admin system. It features a tabbed interface allowing users to "CREATE NEW LETTER", "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER", and view "Letter Key Hints".
The "CREATE NEW LETTER" and "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER" sections include forms for defining letter properties such as:
- **Request Type** (e.g., 'NOC' which has a sub-type)
- **Hard Copy Option**: A toggle to "Allow request for hard copy".
- **Letter Category**: Multiple selection for categorizing letters.
- **Date Format**: Configurable date format for the letter.
- **Team Calendar Integration**: A toggle to "Show in Team Calendar", with a hint about using `[fromDate]` and `[toDate]`.
- **Request Limiting**: A toggle to "Limit the number of requests", which, when enabled, exposes fields for `limit_period` (e.g., "ytd" or a specific number of days), `request_limit` (maximum number of requests allowed), and `limit_exceeded_action` (e.g., "restrictCreation" or "notifyLineManager").
The "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER" tab provides functionalities to delete letter templates and preview them (PDF Preview and Before Approve Preview) using a `CreateLetter` sub-component within dialogs. The consistent code snippets across multiple timestamps suggest a stable state or repeated logging of the same version without further modifications in these specific entries.

`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue` (23/10/2025, 11:08:05, 11:24:08, 11:24:20)
This Vue component serves as an HR self-service portal where employees can create various requests.
- **Initial State (11:08:05):** The component supports request types like 'Leave', 'Loan', 'Education', 'WFH', 'Claim', 'Letters', and 'Passport Release', each corresponding to a dedicated creation component (e.g., `CreateLeaves`, `CreateLoan`). The 'Claim' request type includes a tooltip detailing mandatory fields and a receipt attachment limit of **2MB**. A "Team Calendar" is present for Leave and WFH requests.
- **Later Changes (11:24:08 onwards):** The primary change reflected in these later identical entries is the **reversion of the claim receipt file size limit back to 2MB** in the tooltip, after it was temporarily increased elsewhere (as seen in the `binhendi-mcs-admin` version of this file). The component's overall structure and the types of requests it handles remain consistent with the initial entry for this specific path.

`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue` (23/10/2025, 11:13:46, 11:15:08, 11:15:28)
This is a separate `requests.vue` component, likely belonging to a different admin instance (`binhendi-mcs-admin`). It shows significant updates compared to the `binhendi-admin` version.
- **Expanded Request Types:** New request types are introduced: 'Salary Advance' (`CreateSalaryAdvance`), 'Time Off Lieu' (`CreateTimeOffLieu`), and 'Trip Request' (`CreateTripRequest`).
- **Claim Receipt Limit Increase:** The claim request tooltip explicitly states the receipt attachment size limit has been increased to **10MB**.
- **Enhanced LetterRequest Props:** The `LetterRequest` component now receives additional props: `referenceNumber`, `canRequestHardCopy`, and an explicit `selectedEmp` as `user`.
- **Team Calendar Logic:** The conditional rendering for the "Team Calendar" is made more flexible, now triggering if `showInTeamCalendar` is true OR `requestType` includes 'leave'. The calendar menu also dynamically shows "Letter Type" or "Leave Type" based on `selectedEvent.isTeamCalendar`.
The multiple identical entries here indicate the changes were applied and maintained across these timestamps.

`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/test-pronouns.js` (23/10/2025, 11:23:34)
This is a JavaScript test script focused on context-aware pronoun capitalization. It defines a `replaceContextAwarePronoun` function that:
- Takes a text, a pronoun placeholder (e.g., `[Him/Her]`), male and female forms, and a gender.
- Replaces the placeholder with the correct gendered pronoun.
- Capitalizes the pronoun if it appears at the beginning of a sentence.
- It uses a temporary marker to avoid replacement issues.
The script includes a set of test cases to validate this functionality, demonstrating a concern for proper grammar and personalization in dynamically generated content.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**
- **Vue.js Development:** A strong pattern of Vue.js component development is evident, with extensive use of Vuetify components for UI consistency and functionality.
- **HR/Admin Functionality:** The changes predominantly revolve around HR self-service requests and administrative configurations, especially concerning letter generation and request management (leaves, loans, claims, etc.).
- **Dynamic Content Generation:** The `LetterTemplate.vue` component's ability to define merge fields, coupled with the `test-pronouns.js` script, highlights a system designed for generating personalized documents or communications.
- **Request Workflow Features:** Common features across request types include approval flows, application logs, and configurable limits, suggesting a robust system for managing employee requests.
- **Configuration and Customization:** Many aspects like date formats, letter categories, and request limits are configurable, indicating flexibility in system setup.

## 14:54:19
The provided log details several code changes across different projects and components, primarily focusing on request management, letter generation, and a new utility script for pronoun handling.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 23/10/2025, 11:08:00 to 23/10/2025, 14:05:44.
    *   **Summary:** This Vue component functions as an administrative interface for configuring letter templates. It allows users to define new letter types or update existing ones, specifying attributes like sub-type, category, date format, and options such as hard copy availability, display in a team calendar, and request limitations (including limit period and action on exceedance). It integrates a `CreateLetter` component for editing and provides preview functionalities for both PDF and a "Before Approve" state. The provided code snippets are identical across all listed timestamps, suggesting non-substantive changes (e.g., whitespace, comments, or changes outside the snippet scope) or repeated saves.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/test-pronouns.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, 11:23:34.
    *   **Summary:** This is a newly introduced JavaScript test script. It implements a `replaceContextAwarePronoun` function, using the `lodash` library, to intelligently replace gender-neutral placeholders (e.g., `[Him/Her]`, `[His/Her]`) with gender-specific pronouns and apply correct capitalization if the pronoun appears at the beginning of a sentence. The script includes test cases to validate this context-aware replacement.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/document-editor/wordeditor.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 23/10/2025, 12:52:55 to 23/10/2025, 13:07:46.
    *   **Significant Change at 23/10/2025, 12:53:29:** A console log message in the `reloadTableData` function was modified to include more asterisks and "Show" prefix.
    *   **Summary:** This Vue component provides a document editing interface leveraging Syncfusion components. It supports saving documents as DOCX and downloading them as PDF. Users can insert various merge fields (text, table, image types) via list views and dialogs. The PDF download functionality makes an API call to an external document editor service (`api/DocumentEditor/DocToPDF`) for conversion. The `reloadTableData` function dynamically populates the merge field lists. Beyond the console log change, subsequent code snippets are identical.

    *   **Summary:** This backend service handles the core logic for generating letter content for both preview and PDF output. It includes functions to convert image URLs to base64, combine HTML components, and apply various styles and dynamic data. It involves HTML entity decoding and significant string manipulation to format letters. The provided code snippets are identical across these timestamps.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/services/letter_request.service.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 23/10/2025, 13:22:56 to 23/10/2025, 14:30:50.
    *   **Summary:** This service manages the entire lifecycle of letter requests within the API. It processes new requests by fetching user, company, and letter configuration data. It dynamically populates extensive letter fields (e.g., passport details, salary, allowances, manager information) and constructs multi-level approval flows, including validation of approvers. A key feature is the implementation of request limits, where it checks if a user has exceeded predefined limits for specific letter types within a given period (e.g., year-to-date) and applies actions like restricting creation or notifying managers. It also generates unique identifiers for requests and integrates with helper functions for dynamic letter configuration. The provided code snippets are identical across all listed timestamps.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/controllers/letter.controller.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, 14:06:30.
    *   **Summary:** This controller handles the downloading and previewing of letters. It retrieves letter request, applicant, and company details, then utilizes a PDF generation library (`pdf-creator-node`) to convert HTML content into PDF. It includes helper functions for internal letter preview generation, which populates letter fields with additional data and uses an external document editor API to replace content and produce HTML. The download function checks if a PDF already exists to avoid redundant generation. The provided code snippet shows no changes.

    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 23/10/2025, 14:05:17 to 23/10/2025, 14:47:07.
    *   **Summary:** This component offers a "Team Central" interface for managers and administrators to manage various employee requests. It supports creating requests such as Leave, Time Off Lieu, WFH, Salary Advance, Claim, Attendance, Letters, Salary Adjustment, and Trip Request for selected employees. The interface includes a list view for "All Requests" or "All Pending Requests" with a search function, and a section for support tickets. It dynamically renders different request components and reuses the `LetterRequest` component with manager/admin-specific props. The code content in the provided snippets is identical across all listed timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Request-Driven Architecture:** A strong pattern across both `binhendi-admin` and `binhendi-mcs-admin` is the focus on various types of employee requests (e.g., letters, leave, loans, claims, WFH). These requests often involve multi-level approval flows and configurable settings.
*   **Letter Generation and Management:** A significant and recurring theme is the robust implementation of letter generation. This includes:
    *   **Dynamic Fields:** Letters incorporate dynamic merge fields for text, tables, and images, populated with employee-specific data.
    *   **Styling and Previews:** Detailed control over letter styling for both on-screen previews and PDF output, including header, footer, date positioning, and signatory information.
    *   **Request Limits:** Backend logic enforces limits on the number of letter requests an employee can make within certain periods, with configurable actions (e.g., restrict or notify).
*   **Component Reusability:** Core functionality related to letter requests (e.g., `CreateLetter`, `LetterRequest`, `PreviewLetter`) is encapsulated in reusable Vue components, facilitating consistent UI/UX and development efficiency across different user roles (self-service, team central, admin central).
*   **Backend-Frontend Integration for Document Processing:** The system uses a dedicated document editor service for converting rich text content into PDF, with the frontend (`wordeditor.vue`) handling user interaction and the backend (`letter.service.js`, `letter.controller.js`) orchestrating the conversion via an API endpoint.
*   **Environment Variable Usage:** API endpoints and AWS configurations are consistently managed through environment variables (`process.env`), indicating a standard practice for managing sensitive or environment-specific settings.
*   **External Library Reliance:** Libraries like `moment-timezone`, `lodash`, `mongoose`, `axios`, `pdf-creator-node`, `he`, `@syncfusion/ej2-vue-documenteditor`, `countries-list`, and `numbers2words` are frequently used, indicating a reliance on established tools for date handling, utility functions, database interaction, HTTP requests, PDF generation, HTML parsing, and rich text editing.
*   **Frequent, Non-Substantive Commits:** A notable pattern is numerous log entries for the same file path and identical code snippets within very short timeframes. This suggests frequent saves or automated version control commits that captured minor, unrecorded changes (e.g., whitespace adjustments, comment changes, or modifications outside the provided snippets) rather than significant functional alterations.
