# Activity Summary for 03/10/2025

## 12:35:18
The provided log details several changes to a single file, `/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`, a Vue.js component likely used for creating and managing leave requests within an HRMS admin panel.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 03/10/2025, 12:20:25**: The `showLeaveBalance` method, triggered on `mouseenter` for leave type selection items, was updated to explicitly pass the event object (`$event`). This suggests the method now requires access to event details, likely for precise positioning of the leave balance information bubble.
    *   **Timestamp: 03/10/2025, 12:20:49**: Dynamic CSS classes (`sick-leave` and `annual-leave`) were added to the `leave-balance-bubble` component. This allows for specific styling or visual differentiation of the leave balance display based on whether the hovered leave type is sick leave or annual leave, enhancing the user interface.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The most notable changes occurred between 12:20:25 and 12:20:49 on March 10, 2025, focusing on improving the interactive display of leave balance details when a user hovers over different leave types in the selection dropdown. The earlier timestamps (12:19:08, 12:19:17, 12:19:51, 12:20:12) and later timestamps (12:20:39, 12:21:29, 12:21:56) for this file show identical content to their immediately preceding entry, indicating no new code changes were committed at those specific times relative to the previous log entry.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused UI Refinement**: The changes are highly localized to the "leave type" selection and its associated "leave balance bubble" display, indicating an iterative refinement process for this specific UI element.
*   **Vuetify Framework**: The code consistently uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-select`, `v-menu`, `v-text-field`, `v-date-picker`, `v-file-input`, `v-textarea`, `v-btn`), which is a recurring pattern in the file structure and component usage.
*   **Internationalization**: The extensive use of `$t('...')` throughout the template confirms that the component is built with internationalization in mind, supporting multiple languages for its labels and messages.
*   **Uncommitted/Commented Code**: Several large blocks of HTML (`<!-- <Leaves ... /> -->`, `<!-- <v-col v-if="leave?.leave_type?.leave_name ..."> -->`, `<!-- <v-col v-if="Object.keys(computedSickLeavePayments)..."> -->`, `<!-- <v-col class="text-right" cols="5" v-if="remaining_leaves_count"> -->`) are commented out in the template. This suggests ongoing development, debugging, or the temporary disabling of certain features related to leave breakdown or remaining leave counts.

**File-Specific Updates (based on the common content across all logs):**
The `createLeaves.vue` component, written in Vue.js using the Vuetify framework, is designed for managing leave applications. Key aspects of its functionality include:

*   **Leave Summary Display:** It presents current leave statistics such as the total "no_of_days" requested, "leaves_remaining" (conditionally displayed if not an unpaid leave), and "overflow_unpaid" days (if the leave type allows overflow to unpaid).
*   **Interactive Leave Type Selection:** Users can select a leave type from a dropdown (`v-select`). A notable feature is a hover-triggered "Leave Balance Bubble" (`v-card`) that provides a detailed breakdown of the hovered leave type.
    *   **Sick Leave Details:** Displays entitlement, balance, and utilization for "Full Pay," "75% Pay," and "Unpaid" categories. It also includes a prompt to navigate to history for a full breakdown.
    *   **Annual Leave Details:** Shows entitlement, carry over, used days, accrued year-to-date (YTD), and the total annual balance.
    *   **Other Leave Types:** Presents entitlement, balance, and used days.
*   **Half-Day Option:** A "leave_option" dropdown is conditionally available (`v-if="isHalfDayAvailable"`) for selecting half-day leaves.
*   **Compassionate Leave Note:** A specific informational note (`red--text`) is displayed for "Compassionate Leaves" outlining eligibility criteria (e.g., 5 days for immediate family death, 3 days for in-laws/grandparents, 1 day for others).
*   **Date Range Selection:** Users can select "start_date" (`leave.from_date`) and "end_date" (`leave.to_date`) using `v-date-picker` components, with validation and various event handlers (`updateEndDate`, `halfDayCheck`, `checkForHolidays`, `checkLeaveBlackout`).
*   **Document Upload:** The component includes a file input (`v-file-input`) for "upload_documents," which is conditionally required (`attachment_required`). It accepts a wide range of file types, including images, audio, video, and common document formats (doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, pdf).

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**
*   **Vuetify Components:** The entire UI is built using Vuetify components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, `v-date-picker`, `v-text-field`, `v-file-input`, etc.).
*   **Internationalization:** Extensive use of `$t('...')` placeholders indicates the component is designed with internationalization in mind, allowing for easy translation of UI texts.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Many UI elements, especially the leave balance details and the half-day option, are conditionally rendered using `v-if`, `v-else-if`, and `v-else` directives, ensuring a dynamic user experience based on selected leave types and other conditions.
*   **Data Binding and Event Handling:** Vue's `v-model` is used for two-way data binding, and `@change`, `@input`, `@mouseenter`, `@mouseleave`, and `@blur` events trigger various methods to update the form state and display information.
*   **Styling:** Inline styles and custom classes (e.g., `darkBlue-heading-text`, `redTextForm`, `leave-item-hover`, `leave-balance-bubble`) are used for precise visual control.
*   **Form Validation:** All input fields utilize `:rules="genericRule"` or specific `fileRules` to ensure data integrity.

The code itself shows recurring usage of Vuetify components (`<v-row>`, `<v-col>`, `<v-card-text>`, `<v-select>`, `<v-menu>`, `<v-date-picker>`, `<v-file-input>`) and i18n translation keys (e.g., `{{ $t('no_of_days') }}`).

## 15:35:19
The log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`. All modifications occurred on October 3, 2025, between 14:36:51 and 15:34:31.

**File-Specific Updates (`createLeaves.vue`):**

*   **Initial State (03/10/2025, 14:36:51):** The component was structured for creating leave requests. It displayed current leave statistics (no. of days, remaining, unpaid overflow), and featured a `v-select` for choosing leave types. A notable feature was a "Leave Balance Bubble" that appeared on hover, providing detailed breakdowns for Sick Leave (full pay, 75% pay, unpaid entitlement, balance, utilization), Annual Leave (entitlement, carry over, used, accrued YTD, total balance), and other leave types (entitlement, balance, used). The form also included a `v-select` for half-day options, a specific note for compassionate leave eligibility, date pickers for start and end dates, a file input for documents (with dynamic `attachment_required`), and a partially complete `reason` textarea.

*   **Functional Completion (03/10/2025, 15:27:15):** This update completed the `reason` input field, dynamically setting its required status based on `leave.leave_type.is_reason_optional`. Crucially, it introduced the "Submit" button, enabling users to apply for leave. The submit button's disabled state was controlled by a complex set of conditions, including `checkLeaveDays`, `computedCheckLeaveBlackout`, various `computeAddRequestButton` flags, `computeHajjLeave`, and `hasApprovers`.

*   **Minor Styling Refinements (03/10/2025, 15:33:03 and 15:34:31):** The final two changes involved small adjustments to the styling of the "Leave Balance Bubble". Specifically, the `pa-3 white--text` classes were removed from the `v-card-title` element. Additionally, the conditional application of the `other-leave-header` class was removed from the `v-card-title` in the 15:33:03 update, signifying a slight change in how the header styling for non-sick/non-annual leave types is determined.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **03/10/2025, 14:36:51:** Initial documented state, showing core UI elements and the interactive leave balance bubble.
*   **03/10/2025, 15:27:15:** Introduction of the complete reason field validation and the "Submit" button, making the form fully functional for leave application.
*   **03/10/2025, 15:33:03 & 15:34:31:** Minor, consecutive styling adjustments.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vuetify Framework:** The component heavily utilizes Vuetify components for its UI (`v-card-text`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, `v-date-picker`, `v-file-input`, `v-textarea`, `v-btn`).
*   **Internationalization:** The `$t()` function is consistently used for all displayed text, indicating support for multiple languages.
*   **Dynamic UI/Logic:** Extensive use of `v-if` for conditional rendering and dynamic class/style bindings, as well as complex computed properties and methods (e.g., `computedDateFormatted_fromDate`, `getMinimumStartDate`, `updateLeaveEndDateWithRemainingDays`, `handleLeaveTypeOnchange`, `showLeaveBalance`, `applyLeave`), to manage the form's behavior and data display.
*   **Leave Management Focus:** The entire component is dedicated to applying for various types of leaves, including displaying detailed balance information, managing dates, and requiring attachments/reasons.
*   **Iterative Development:** The sequence of changes suggests an iterative development process, starting with core UI, then adding crucial interactive logic, and concluding with minor aesthetic refinements.

## 16:35:27
The changes log primarily revolves around enhancements to a leave application component and its associated documentation. All modifications occurred on 03/10/2025 within a short timeframe, indicating a focused development effort.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`**

This Vue.js component (`createLeaves.vue`) is responsible for handling the creation of leave requests.

*   **Initial State (03/10/2025, 15:35:48 and 15:40:12):** The component already included a detailed "Leave Balance Bubble" feature. This bubble would appear when hovering over a leave type in the `v-select` dropdown, providing breakdowns for different leave types. For Sick Leave, it showed "Full Pay Breakdown," "75% Pay Breakdown," and "Unpaid Breakdown" with entitlements, balances, and utilization. For Annual Leave, it displayed "Entitlement," "Carry Over," "Used," "Accrued YTD," and the "Annual Balance."
*   **Significant Update (03/10/2025, 15:40:29):** A crucial refinement was made to the "Leave Balance Bubble" functionality. The `@mouseenter` and `@mouseleave` events on the `v-list-item` for selecting leave types were updated. Previously, the bubble would appear for any hovered leave type. With this change, the bubble is now conditionally activated to show only when the hovered leave type is identified as "Annual Leave" or "Sick Leave" (`isAnnualLeave(item) || isSickLeave(item)`). This improves the user experience by limiting the display of detailed breakdowns to relevant leave categories and avoids showing an empty or generic bubble for other leave types.
*   **Other Recurring Elements:** The component consistently displays general leave information such as "no_of_days," "leaves_remaining," and "overflow_unpaid" counts. It also includes standard form elements for leave applications, such as start and end date pickers, a document upload section (with conditional requirement for attachments), and a reason textarea (also with conditional requirement). The submit button has multiple conditions for disabling, ensuring valid leave applications. The UI extensively uses Vuetify components for its structure and styling, including a progress linear indicator for loading states.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/Leave_Balance_Bubble_Implementation.md`**

This markdown document served as a detailed description of the "Leave Balance Bubble" feature.

*   **Creation (03/10/2025, 15:52:42):** The document was created to outline the implementation of the "Leave Balance Bubble" in detail. It covered:
    *   **Overview:** Describing the use of Vuetify for the hover functionality and matching design requirements.
    *   **Features Implemented:** Detailing the Vuetify-based hover interaction, enhanced Sick Leave bubble (full, 75%, unpaid pay breakdowns), and a new Annual Leave bubble (entitlement, carry over, used, accrued YTD, annual balance). It also briefly mentioned display for other leave types.
    *   **Technical Implementation:** Provided specifics on template changes (Vuetify components), enhanced JavaScript methods (`getSickLeaveEntitlement`, `getSickLeaveBalance`, `getSickLeaveUtilization`), data properties (`showBubble`, `hoveredLeaveType`, `bubblePosition`), and CSS styling (color-coded headers, animations).
    *   **Data Structure Support:** Explained how the implementation supports multiple field name variations for leave data.
    *   **Layout Matching Screenshot:** Illustrated the expected layout for Sick Leave and Annual Leave bubbles.
    *   **Compatibility:** Noted compatibility with Vue.js 2.x + Vuetify 2.x and modern web features.
    *   **Usage Instructions:** A brief guide on how to interact with the feature.
*   **Content Removal (03/10/2025, 15:54:25):** Shortly after its creation, the content of this file was removed, or the file itself was effectively cleared. This suggests it might have been a temporary documentation, a draft, or a changelog that was no longer needed after the feature was implemented and finalized, or perhaps moved to another location.

**Overall Patterns:**

The changes indicate a strong focus on enhancing the user interface and experience for leave applications, particularly by providing richer, on-demand information about leave balances through a dynamic hover bubble. The use of Vuetify is a consistent theme across the UI elements. The rapid sequence of updates suggests iterative refinement of a specific feature.
