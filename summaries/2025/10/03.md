# Activity Summary for 03/10/2025

## 12:35:18
The provided log details several changes to a single file, `/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`, a Vue.js component likely used for creating and managing leave requests within an HRMS admin panel.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 03/10/2025, 12:20:25**: The `showLeaveBalance` method, triggered on `mouseenter` for leave type selection items, was updated to explicitly pass the event object (`$event`). This suggests the method now requires access to event details, likely for precise positioning of the leave balance information bubble.
    *   **Timestamp: 03/10/2025, 12:20:49**: Dynamic CSS classes (`sick-leave` and `annual-leave`) were added to the `leave-balance-bubble` component. This allows for specific styling or visual differentiation of the leave balance display based on whether the hovered leave type is sick leave or annual leave, enhancing the user interface.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The most notable changes occurred between 12:20:25 and 12:20:49 on March 10, 2025, focusing on improving the interactive display of leave balance details when a user hovers over different leave types in the selection dropdown. The earlier timestamps (12:19:08, 12:19:17, 12:19:51, 12:20:12) and later timestamps (12:20:39, 12:21:29, 12:21:56) for this file show identical content to their immediately preceding entry, indicating no new code changes were committed at those specific times relative to the previous log entry.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused UI Refinement**: The changes are highly localized to the "leave type" selection and its associated "leave balance bubble" display, indicating an iterative refinement process for this specific UI element.
*   **Vuetify Framework**: The code consistently uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-select`, `v-menu`, `v-text-field`, `v-date-picker`, `v-file-input`, `v-textarea`, `v-btn`), which is a recurring pattern in the file structure and component usage.
*   **Internationalization**: The extensive use of `$t('...')` throughout the template confirms that the component is built with internationalization in mind, supporting multiple languages for its labels and messages.
*   **Uncommitted/Commented Code**: Several large blocks of HTML (`<!-- <Leaves ... /> -->`, `<!-- <v-col v-if="leave?.leave_type?.leave_name ..."> -->`, `<!-- <v-col v-if="Object.keys(computedSickLeavePayments)..."> -->`, `<!-- <v-col class="text-right" cols="5" v-if="remaining_leaves_count"> -->`) are commented out in the template. This suggests ongoing development, debugging, or the temporary disabling of certain features related to leave breakdown or remaining leave counts.
