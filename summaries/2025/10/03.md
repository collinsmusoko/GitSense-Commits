# Activity Summary for 03/10/2025

## 12:35:18
The provided log details several changes to a single file, `/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`, a Vue.js component likely used for creating and managing leave requests within an HRMS admin panel.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 03/10/2025, 12:20:25**: The `showLeaveBalance` method, triggered on `mouseenter` for leave type selection items, was updated to explicitly pass the event object (`$event`). This suggests the method now requires access to event details, likely for precise positioning of the leave balance information bubble.
    *   **Timestamp: 03/10/2025, 12:20:49**: Dynamic CSS classes (`sick-leave` and `annual-leave`) were added to the `leave-balance-bubble` component. This allows for specific styling or visual differentiation of the leave balance display based on whether the hovered leave type is sick leave or annual leave, enhancing the user interface.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The most notable changes occurred between 12:20:25 and 12:20:49 on March 10, 2025, focusing on improving the interactive display of leave balance details when a user hovers over different leave types in the selection dropdown. The earlier timestamps (12:19:08, 12:19:17, 12:19:51, 12:20:12) and later timestamps (12:20:39, 12:21:29, 12:21:56) for this file show identical content to their immediately preceding entry, indicating no new code changes were committed at those specific times relative to the previous log entry.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused UI Refinement**: The changes are highly localized to the "leave type" selection and its associated "leave balance bubble" display, indicating an iterative refinement process for this specific UI element.
*   **Vuetify Framework**: The code consistently uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-select`, `v-menu`, `v-text-field`, `v-date-picker`, `v-file-input`, `v-textarea`, `v-btn`), which is a recurring pattern in the file structure and component usage.
*   **Internationalization**: The extensive use of `$t('...')` throughout the template confirms that the component is built with internationalization in mind, supporting multiple languages for its labels and messages.
*   **Uncommitted/Commented Code**: Several large blocks of HTML (`<!-- <Leaves ... /> -->`, `<!-- <v-col v-if="leave?.leave_type?.leave_name ..."> -->`, `<!-- <v-col v-if="Object.keys(computedSickLeavePayments)..."> -->`, `<!-- <v-col class="text-right" cols="5" v-if="remaining_leaves_count"> -->`) are commented out in the template. This suggests ongoing development, debugging, or the temporary disabling of certain features related to leave breakdown or remaining leave counts.

The provided log entries track changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/payfuture/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The entries span a period from 03/10/2025, 12:54:24 to 03/10/2025, 13:25:48. However, all logged code snippets are identical. This indicates that while the file was saved multiple times within this timeframe, no substantive code changes were introduced or maintained across these specific log points. The tool likely captured save events without reflecting actual modifications to the file's content in the provided snippets.

**File-Specific Updates (based on the common content across all logs):**
The `createLeaves.vue` component, written in Vue.js using the Vuetify framework, is designed for managing leave applications. Key aspects of its functionality include:

*   **Leave Summary Display:** It presents current leave statistics such as the total "no_of_days" requested, "leaves_remaining" (conditionally displayed if not an unpaid leave), and "overflow_unpaid" days (if the leave type allows overflow to unpaid).
*   **Interactive Leave Type Selection:** Users can select a leave type from a dropdown (`v-select`). A notable feature is a hover-triggered "Leave Balance Bubble" (`v-card`) that provides a detailed breakdown of the hovered leave type.
    *   **Sick Leave Details:** Displays entitlement, balance, and utilization for "Full Pay," "75% Pay," and "Unpaid" categories. It also includes a prompt to navigate to history for a full breakdown.
    *   **Annual Leave Details:** Shows entitlement, carry over, used days, accrued year-to-date (YTD), and the total annual balance.
    *   **Other Leave Types:** Presents entitlement, balance, and used days.
*   **Half-Day Option:** A "leave_option" dropdown is conditionally available (`v-if="isHalfDayAvailable"`) for selecting half-day leaves.
*   **Compassionate Leave Note:** A specific informational note (`red--text`) is displayed for "Compassionate Leaves" outlining eligibility criteria (e.g., 5 days for immediate family death, 3 days for in-laws/grandparents, 1 day for others).
*   **Date Range Selection:** Users can select "start_date" (`leave.from_date`) and "end_date" (`leave.to_date`) using `v-date-picker` components, with validation and various event handlers (`updateEndDate`, `halfDayCheck`, `checkForHolidays`, `checkLeaveBlackout`).
*   **Document Upload:** The component includes a file input (`v-file-input`) for "upload_documents," which is conditionally required (`attachment_required`). It accepts a wide range of file types, including images, audio, video, and common document formats (doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, pdf).

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**
*   **Vuetify Components:** The entire UI is built using Vuetify components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, `v-date-picker`, `v-text-field`, `v-file-input`, etc.).
*   **Internationalization:** Extensive use of `$t('...')` placeholders indicates the component is designed with internationalization in mind, allowing for easy translation of UI texts.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Many UI elements, especially the leave balance details and the half-day option, are conditionally rendered using `v-if`, `v-else-if`, and `v-else` directives, ensuring a dynamic user experience based on selected leave types and other conditions.
*   **Data Binding and Event Handling:** Vue's `v-model` is used for two-way data binding, and `@change`, `@input`, `@mouseenter`, `@mouseleave`, and `@blur` events trigger various methods to update the form state and display information.
*   **Styling:** Inline styles and custom classes (e.g., `darkBlue-heading-text`, `redTextForm`, `leave-item-hover`, `leave-balance-bubble`) are used for precise visual control.
*   **Form Validation:** All input fields utilize `:rules="genericRule"` or specific `fileRules` to ensure data integrity.
