# Activity Summary for 25/10/2025

## 12:12:27
The provided log details a series of minor changes made to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/document-editor/wordeditor.vue`.

This Vue component is designed as a rich word editor, leveraging Syncfusion's Document Editor. It features capabilities to save documents as DOCX, download as PDF, and interactively insert "merge fields" (text, table, image) into the document from a sidebar. These merge fields are managed through modal dialogs for adding new fields and displayed using `ejs-listview` components.

The significant changes occurred between 11:11:45 and 11:38:21 on 25/10/2025, and all were confined to the `reloadTableData` method within the script section of the `wordeditor.vue` file.

*   **25/10/2025, 11:11:45:** The `reloadTableData` method initially contained two `console.log` statements for debugging `elements.text` and `elements`.
*   **25/10/2025, 11:34:33:** One of the `console.log` statements (`elements`) was removed, and a new one was introduced to specifically log `this.listDataText`. This indicates a shift in focus for debugging, likely related to the data structure being populated for the list views.
*   **25/10/2025, 11:36:01:** The newly added `console.log` was modified to attempt logging `this.listDataText.text`, suggesting an attempt to access a specific property within the `listDataText` array's elements.
*   **25/10/2025, 11:37:30:** This `console.log` was further changed to `this.listDataText.item`, another attempt to access a property that might not exist directly on the array.
*   **25/10/2025, 11:38:21:** The `console.log` statement was reverted to its state at 11:34:33, logging the entire `this.listDataText` array.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes consistently involve minor adjustments to `console.log` statements within the `reloadTableData` function. This pattern strongly suggests an iterative debugging process, likely focused on understanding the exact structure and content of the `listDataText` array after it has been mapped from the `elements.text` prop, or how the Vue reactivity is handling the updates to `listDataText`. The core functionality of the component, including the UI layout, document editing features, and integration with the Syncfusion libraries, remained untouched throughout these modifications.
