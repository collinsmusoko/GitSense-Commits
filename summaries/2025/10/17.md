# Activity Summary for 17/10/2025

## 19:00:34
The changes log details a rapid sequence of updates focused on establishing core authentication, authorization, and UI layout components for a `tell_media_admin` project on `17/10/2025`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/utils/tokenStorage.ts` (17/10/2025, 18:27:53):**
    This file was introduced to provide a `TokenStorage` utility class. It implements a secure token storage mechanism by prioritizing in-memory storage for maximum security and using `sessionStorage` as a fallback for persistence across tab refreshes, explicitly chosen over `localStorage` for enhanced XSS protection. The class includes methods for `setTokens`, `getAccessToken`, `getRefreshToken`, `setAccessToken`, `clearTokens`, `isAuthenticated`, and `initializeFromStorage`, with error handling for `sessionStorage` operations. A singleton instance of `TokenStorage` is exported.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/services/authService.ts` (17/10/2025, 18:28:22 and 18:28:44):**
    This service file was introduced (first timestamp) to manage all authentication-related logic. It integrates with `tokenStorage` for secure token handling and `axiosInstance` for API calls. Key static methods include `login` (which stores received tokens), `logout` (which clears local tokens even if the backend request fails), `checkAuth` (validates authentication status and fetches user profiles), `getProfile`, `refreshToken` (to update access tokens), and `initializeAuth` (to load tokens on page refresh). The second timestamp indicates no functional change from the first for this file, likely a minor save event.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/app/user/layout.tsx` (Multiple timestamps from 17/10/2025, 18:36:15 to 18:45:44):**
    This Next.js layout component for the user dashboard underwent several iterative updates:
    *   **18:36:15:** The initial version of `DashboardLayout` was introduced. It features a responsive sidebar with toggle functionality, Redux integration to fetch and display user authentication status and profile, and a role-based navigation system. Navigation items include a `name`, `href`, `icon` (initially as a string path), `accessTag` for permission control, and a `description`. User details, including a profile picture (with a placeholder), and role-based access information are dynamically displayed in the sidebar.
    *   **18:36:28:** A functional and stylistic improvement was made by changing how navigation icons are rendered. Instead of directly using the icon path string, `next/image` components were adopted for better image optimization and handling.
    *   **18:41:04:** The icon path for the 'Admin Central' navigation item was updated from `/static/admin_central.svg` to `/static/myHrselfservice.svg`.
    *   **18:41:33:** The icon path for the 'Content Central' navigation item was updated from `/static/myWork.svg` to `/static/admin_central.svg`.
    *   **18:45:44:** The icon path for the 'Analytics' navigation item was updated from `/static/myHrselfservice.svg` to `/static/myWork.svg`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes demonstrate a concerted effort to build out the foundational layers of a web application with a strong emphasis on user management and UI. Key patterns include:
*   **Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure:** The simultaneous introduction and integration of `tokenStorage.ts` and `authService.ts` with the `layout.tsx` component highlights the rapid development of a complete authentication and role-based access control system.
*   **Next.js and Redux Integration:** The `DashboardLayout` extensively uses Next.js features for navigation and image handling (`next/image`), alongside Redux for managing global application state related to authentication and user profiles, indicating a modern web development stack.
*   **Iterative UI/UX Refinement:** The multiple, closely timed updates to `layout.tsx`, particularly concerning navigation icon paths, suggest an iterative process of refining the user interface and experience.
*   **Security Considerations:** Explicit mention of XSS protection and `sessionStorage` choice in `tokenStorage.ts` points to a focus on security best practices from the outset.
*   **Modular Development:** The separation of concerns into distinct utility, service, and UI components reflects a modular and organized approach to codebase structure.
