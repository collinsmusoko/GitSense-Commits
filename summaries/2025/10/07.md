# Activity Summary for 07/10/2025

The `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue` component, updated on **July 10, 2025, at 08:54:46**, focuses on managing and displaying team shift schedules within an admin panel.

Key updates and features observed include:

*   **Bulk Upload Shift Schedule Dialog**: A new dialog has been implemented allowing users to upload shift schedules via Excel files. This feature includes options to download an Excel template, select a file with validation for `.xlsx` or `.xls` formats, display error messages, and manage the upload process with a loading indicator.
*   **Enhanced Shift Calendar View**: The main interface is a `v-calendar` component for viewing shifts. It supports filtering by work location and department, navigating through months, and displaying a loading indicator for calendar data.
*   **Shift Management Actions**: The component now provides several dedicated actions:
    *   **Shift Lock**: An icon button to open a shift lock mechanism.
    *   **Shift Logs**: An icon button to access shift history logs.
    *   **Bulk Upload for Specific Users**: A conditional option (visible on `dashboards/my-team` path) using an SVG icon for targeted bulk uploads.
    *   **Shift Roster Dialog**: An informational dialog (`mdi-information`) that lists all defined shifts, detailing their names, abbreviations, colors, start/end times, and total hours. It explicitly handles "Off" shifts by displaying "---" for times and supports split shifts by showing primary and secondary time slots.
*   **Calendar Event Details**:
    *   Events displayed on the calendar show the shift title and the number of associated team members.
    *   Clicking a single event opens a dialog (`eventDialog`) to show detailed shift information and a list of assigned team members with their avatars, names, and emails.
    *   For dates with multiple events, a "More Events" dialog (`moreEventsDialog`) lists all shifts for that specific date, allowing users to click on any shift to view its individual details.
*   **Manual Shift Editing/Adding**: Buttons for "Edit" (conditional on `teamView`) and "Add" a manual shift are present, suggesting functionality for direct schedule manipulation.

**Recurring elements and patterns** throughout the code include:
*   Extensive use of Vuetify components for UI elements, adhering to a consistent design language.
*   Widespread implementation of internationalization (`$t()`) for all user-facing text, indicating multi-language support.
*   Conditional rendering (`v-if`, `v-for`) and two-way data binding (`v-model`) are used for dynamic content and interactivity.
*   Visual cues like Material Design Icons (`mdi-`) are utilized for actions and information.
