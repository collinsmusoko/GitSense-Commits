# Activity Summary for 06/10/2025

## 13:36:11
The changes observed are confined to the `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-api/package.json` file, indicating a series of configuration adjustments within the project's scripting environment.

The most significant changes occurred between 06/10/2025, 13:26:45 and 13:31:44, highlighting an active period of modifications focused on development-related scripts.

Specifically, the updates focus on the `scripts` section of the `package.json`:
*   **`dev` script modifications**: The command for the `dev` script underwent several changes. Initially, it used `NODE_OPTIONS=...` (06/10/2025, 13:26:45). This was modified to `SET NODE_OPTIONS=...` (06/10/2025, 13:27:23) and subsequently to `set NODE_OPTIONS=...` (06/10/2025, 13:31:44). This pattern suggests an effort to ensure compatibility across different operating systems or command-line environments (e.g., using `SET` for Windows command prompts) for setting the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable, specifically for increasing the Node.js old space size to 4096MB.
*   **`devs` script introduction and removal**: A new `devs` script, `"cross-env NODE_ENV=development nodemon src/index.js"`, was briefly introduced at 06/10/2025, 13:30:10. This script was a simplified development command without the `NODE_OPTIONS` memory setting. However, it was removed shortly after at 06/10/2025, 13:30:54. This indicates it was likely an experimental script or deemed unnecessary for the final configuration.

The rapid sequence of these changes within a short timeframe suggests an iterative process of testing and refining the development environment setup, particularly concerning how Node.js memory limits are handled and the configuration of development startup commands. No other parts of the `package.json` file, such as dependencies, devDependencies, or core project metadata, were altered during this log.
