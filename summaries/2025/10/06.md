# Activity Summary for 06/10/2025

## 13:36:11
The changes observed are confined to the `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-api/package.json` file, indicating a series of configuration adjustments within the project's scripting environment.

The most significant changes occurred between 06/10/2025, 13:26:45 and 13:31:44, highlighting an active period of modifications focused on development-related scripts.

Specifically, the updates focus on the `scripts` section of the `package.json`:
*   **`dev` script modifications**: The command for the `dev` script underwent several changes. Initially, it used `NODE_OPTIONS=...` (06/10/2025, 13:26:45). This was modified to `SET NODE_OPTIONS=...` (06/10/2025, 13:27:23) and subsequently to `set NODE_OPTIONS=...` (06/10/2025, 13:31:44). This pattern suggests an effort to ensure compatibility across different operating systems or command-line environments (e.g., using `SET` for Windows command prompts) for setting the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable, specifically for increasing the Node.js old space size to 4096MB.
*   **`devs` script introduction and removal**: A new `devs` script, `"cross-env NODE_ENV=development nodemon src/index.js"`, was briefly introduced at 06/10/2025, 13:30:10. This script was a simplified development command without the `NODE_OPTIONS` memory setting. However, it was removed shortly after at 06/10/2025, 13:30:54. This indicates it was likely an experimental script or deemed unnecessary for the final configuration.

The rapid sequence of these changes within a short timeframe suggests an iterative process of testing and refining the development environment setup, particularly concerning how Node.js memory limits are handled and the configuration of development startup commands. No other parts of the `package.json` file, such as dependencies, devDependencies, or core project metadata, were altered during this log.

The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on the `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-api/package.json` file, with one transient entry for `/response_1413cce8-4563-4f35-bb22-6202aeb20703/0`. The content of the `/response_.../0` file appears to be an older or different `package.json` configuration that temporarily influenced the main project's `package.json` but was subsequently reverted.

### File-Specific Updates for `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-api/package.json`

The `package.json` file underwent several rapid changes within a short period on June 10, 2025:

*   **Initial State (06/10/2025, 13:54:11):** The project specified a Node.js engine requirement of `>=14.0.0` and a `dev` script designed for Linux/macOS. Dependencies included `archiver ^7.0.1`, `express ^4.21.0`, `firebase-admin ^11.10.1`, `ioredis ^5.3.2`, `lru-cache ^6.0.0`, `node-fetch ^2.6.7`, `socket.io ^4.8.0`, `winston ^3.2.1`, and `puppeteer ^22.8.2` in overrides.

*   **First Major Update (06/10/2025, 14:05:08):**
    *   The Node.js engine requirement was made more specific, changing from `>=14.0.0` to `v14.15.4`.
    *   The `dev` script was updated to `set NODE_OPTIONS=... && cross-env ...` to accommodate Windows environments.
    *   A significant number of new dependencies were added, including: `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@azure/msal-node` (for Azure authentication), `@nathangroup/claim`, `@nathangroup/leave_email`, `@nathangroup/wfh` (more `@nathangroup` specific modules), `crypto`, `json-2-csv` (for data conversion), and `pdfmake` (another PDF generation tool).
    *   Existing dependencies like `lru-cache` and `node-fetch` were updated to newer major versions (`^10.2.0` and `^3.3.2` respectively).

*   **Significant Reversion and Partial Merge (06/10/2025, 14:08:39):**
    *   This entry represented a complex change, effectively reverting many updates from the previous step. The Node.js engine requirement returned to `>=14.0.0`, and the `dev` script reverted to its initial Linux/macOS format.
    *   All new dependencies added in the `14:05:08` update were removed.
    *   Many existing dependencies were downgraded to older versions (e.g., `archiver` to `^5.3.1`, `express` to `^4.18.2`, `firebase-admin` to `^10.3.0`, `ioredis` to `^4.28.5`, `socket.io` to `^4.6.2`). Notably, `winston` changed from `^3.2.1` to `^3.8.2`.
    *   Dev dependencies and `puppeteer` were also downgraded, and two new overrides, `@so-ric/colorspace` and `@dabh/diagnostics`, were introduced. This state largely mirrored the content found in the separate `/response_.../0` log entry.

*   **Subsequent Reversion and Stabilization (06/10/2025, 14:18:19 and onward):**
    *   Within minutes of the previous reversion, the `package.json` file was again updated at `14:18:19`. This update effectively *undid* the changes from `14:08:39`, restoring the file to the state established at `14:05:08`. This indicates that the partial rollback/merge at `14:08:39` was itself reverted.
    *   The `package.json` content then remained consistent with the `14:05:08` state through all subsequent log entries at `14:18:25`, `14:25:22`, and `14:37:41`.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes

*   **06/10/2025, 13:54:11:** Initial baseline of the `package.json`.
*   **06/10/2025, 14:05:08:** Introduction of major dependency additions (AWS S3 client, Azure auth, new `@nathangroup` modules, PDF tools), significant version bumps, and specific Node.js engine requirement.
*   **06/10/2025, 14:08:39:** A rapid and substantial rollback/merge, downgrading many packages and altering core configurations. This appears to be a temporary or erroneous change.
*   **06/10/2025, 14:18:19:** A corrective action, reverting the `package.json` back to the state of `14:05:08`, followed by stability.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements

*   **Rapid Iteration and Reversion:** The log shows very quick changes to `package.json` (within minutes) and a pattern of significant updates being followed by partial or full reversions, suggesting active development, dependency management challenges, or perhaps conflicting integration attempts.
*   **Focus on PDF Processing:** The presence of multiple PDF-related libraries (`pdf-creator-node`, `pdf-img-convert`, `pdf-lib`, `pdf-parse`, `pdf-poppler`, `pdf2image`, `pdfkit`, `pdfkit-table`, and `pdfmake`) indicates a strong emphasis on PDF generation, manipulation, or parsing functionalities within the project.
*   **Cloud Service Integration:** Dependencies like `aws-sdk`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `firebase-admin`, and `@azure/msal-node` highlight ongoing work with various cloud providers and identity management.
*   **Internal Module Usage:** Several `@nathangroup` scoped packages (`apm`, `attendance`, `claim`, `leave`, `letter`, `payroll`, `ssomatrix`, `wfh`, and their email counterparts) suggest a modular architecture built on a set of internal libraries.
*   **DevOps and Tooling:** The presence of `pm2` for process management, `eslint`, `prettier` for code quality, `jest` for testing, and `docker-compose` scripts indicates a structured development and deployment environment.
*   **Node.js Engine Fluctuation:** The `engines.node` specification changed from a broad range (`>=14.0.0`) to a specific version (`v14.15.4`) and then back, before settling on the specific version. This could indicate attempts to pinpoint a compatible Node.js version or to align with specific environment requirements.

## 15:51:11
The log details changes across two key Vue.js components within the `cybergate-admin` project, specifically related to team management and shift scheduling.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-admin/pages/dashboards/my-team.vue` (Timestamp: 06/10/2025, 14:52:50):**
    *   **New Feature: Team Attendance:** A new card named "Team Attendance" (`id: #employeeAttendance`) was introduced, along with its corresponding `EmployeeAttendance` component. This functionality allows managers to view employee attendance.
    *   **Attendance Filtering:** New methods `getDatesFromFilter`, `filterChanged`, and `getEmployeeAttendance` were added to enable filtering attendance data by "This Week", "This Month", or "Today", and to fetch this data from the backend.
    *   **Shift Management Update:** The "Shift Manager" card (`id: #newShift`) is now the active shift management option, replacing previously commented-out or alternative shift-related cards (`#shift`, `#team-shifts`).
    *   **Calendar Events Enhancement:** The `getEligibleEvents` method was updated to fetch a broader range of events for the team calendar, including "leave", "wfh" (work from home), and "trip" requests.
    *   The component relies heavily on conditional rendering to display various team-related sub-components like `Team`, `EmploymentManagement`, `Shifts`, `NewShift`, `Requests`, `TeamCalendar`, and the newly added `EmployeeAttendance`.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-admin/components/team-central/new-shift.vue` (Timestamps: 06/10/2025, 14:53:24, 14:54:10, 14:57:07, 15:00:26):**
    *   This component focuses on shift roster management and "Auto Build" functionality.
    *   **Minor Text Corrections:** Several rapid changes occurred, primarily involving correcting typos in tooltip texts:
        *   At 14:54:10, a typo in the "Bulk Upload Specific Users" tooltip text was corrected from "Userssss" to "Users".
        *   At 14:57:07, a new typo was introduced in the "Bulk Upload Shift" tooltip, changing it to "Shiftsssss".
        *   At 15:00:26, this latest typo was corrected, reverting the "Bulk Upload Shift" tooltip back to its original "Shift" text.
    *   The component features dynamic resizing based on expansion state and screen breakpoints.
    *   It includes functionality for "Shift Roster" display using `FullCalendar`, offering weekly navigation and work location selection. It also provides a "Team View" with search, department filtering, and a date filter for employee shifts.
    *   Loading indicators are present for fetching configuration and employee shifts.
    *   Options for bulk uploading specific users or shifts, and downloading shift schedules, are available.
    *   An "Auto Build" feature is also present, which appears as a separate view within the component.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **06/10/2025, 14:52:50:** Marks a significant update to the `my-team.vue` dashboard, introducing the "Team Attendance" feature and enhancing calendar event management. This represents a functional expansion of the dashboard.
*   **06/10/2025, 15:00:26:** While individually minor, this timestamp signifies the resolution of minor text-based issues in `new-shift.vue`, bringing the tooltip text to its intended state after a brief period of typo introduction and correction.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Vue.js and Vuetify:** Both files extensively leverage Vue.js for component structure and logic, and Vuetify for rich UI components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-tabs`, `v-tooltip`, `v-select`, `v-progress-linear`).
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Heavy use of `v-if` and dynamic `:class` or `:style` to adapt the UI based on component state, user selections, and data loading status.
*   **Data Fetching and State Management:** Data is fetched asynchronously, often using `$axios.$post` requests with bearer token authentication. User and company-specific data are managed via `$store.getters` and `$store.dispatch`.
*   **Date Handling:** `moment.js` is consistently used for date formatting and manipulation, particularly for attendance and shift scheduling features.
*   **User Feedback:** The use of `v-snackbar` for alerts and `v-tooltip` for contextual information demonstrates a focus on user experience.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The rapid succession of changes in `new-shift.vue` highlights a pattern of immediate correction for minor UI/text issues.
