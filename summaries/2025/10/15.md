# Activity Summary for 15/10/2025

## 10:49:51
The provided log details changes across two Vue.js component files within a project named `babilou-admin`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/shared/header_newww.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 15/10/2025, 10:24:26 and 15/10/2025, 10:26:30. The content for both entries is identical, indicating either a re-save without functional changes or an artifact of the logging process.
    *   **Content:** This file defines a dynamic navigation drawer (sidebar) for the application.
        *   It includes a user profile section displaying the user's name, designation, and a "Work From Home" (WFH) status if applicable.
        *   The navigation is categorized into "General" and "Tools" sections.
        *   "General" navigation items include links to My Work, HR Self Service, Team Central, Admin Central, My Trainings, Training & Development, ATS, Onboarding, Visa Process, Offboarding, Payroll Central, Performance Hub, Assets, and Reports. Many of these links are conditionally rendered based on user roles (`isHRMgrRole`, `isAdminRole`, `isFinanceMgrRole`, `isManagerRole`, `isSuperAdminRole`) or specific `accessTag` values (e.g., 'Team Central', 'Admin Central', 'Payroll').
        *   "ERP Apps" related links (CRM, Client Config, Staffing) are also present and conditionally rendered based on `accessTag`.
        *   The "Tools" section provides links for Support and Configuration, with the Configuration link being restricted to specific employee IDs.
        *   The component heavily utilizes Vuetify components like `v-navigation-drawer`, `v-list`, `v-list-item`, `v-img`, `v-avatar`, and `v-badge` for its structure and styling.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/pages/orgChart/index.vue`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 15/10/2025, 10:48:32 and 15/10/2025, 10:49:23. Similar to the header file, the content is identical across these two timestamps.
    *   **Content:** This file implements an organizational chart page.
        *   It provides extensive interactive features for viewing and manipulating the organizational structure.
        *   **Chart Options:** Users can toggle "Organization Structure" options, which include "Highlight" and "Filter" menus.
            *   Highlight filters allow selecting by "Employee Type" and "Department".
            *   General filters allow filtering by "Department".
        *   **Search and Level Control:** A search bar enables searching for employees, and a "Rows Level" dropdown allows users to control the depth of visible reporting levels in the chart.
        *   **View Controls:** Buttons are available to clear highlights, remove specific highlight links, center the tree, switch between vertical/tree views, and expand/collapse the chart.
        *   **Organizational Chart Display:** The page uses a `vue-tree` component to render the organizational data.
            *   It supports two different `dataset` structures (`ds` and `ds2`) with distinct node templates.
            *   The primary node template displays an employee's image, name, title, and direct reporter count, along with options to email or view more information (email, phone, direct reporter count) via a tooltip and info menu. Nodes can be highlighted with borders based on applied filters.
            *   A secondary node template, used when `swap_view` is active, displays a count and title, likely for an aggregated or different view of the organization.
        *   A temporary debug info card (`showDebug`) is present to display `ds` properties and API loading status.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vuetify Framework:** Both files extensively use Vuetify components for UI, indicating a consistent design system and component library across the application. Common components include `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-list`, `v-list-item`, `v-img`, `v-icon`, `v-btn`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-menu`, and `v-tooltip`.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** A significant pattern is the use of `v-if` directives for conditional rendering of UI elements and navigation links, typically based on user roles (`isHRMgrRole`, `isAdminRole`, `isManagerRole`, `isFinanceMgrRole`, `isSuperAdminRole`) or an `accessTag` property on the user object. This suggests a robust role-based access control (RBAC) implementation.
*   **Dynamic Styling:** Inline styles and dynamic class bindings (`:class`, `:style`) are frequently used to apply conditional visual effects, such as highlighting or opacity changes, based on component state or user data.
*   **Iconography:** The use of `v-icon` and `v-img` with specific SVG or PNG paths (e.g., `/header/mywork.svg`, `/org-chart/filter.svg`) indicates a reliance on a custom or themed icon set.
*   **User Experience Features:** Both files demonstrate a focus on enhancing user experience through features like navigation drawers, search functionality, interactive charts, tooltips, and clear visual cues for actions (e.g., `navigationHover` class).
*   **Rapid Iteration/Re-saves:** The nearly identical content across consecutive timestamps for the same file suggests frequent saves during development, possibly without significant functional code changes in between.
