## 10:46:38
The primary update observed involves the `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` file, with a significant change recorded at **24/10/2025, 10:43:41**.

This Vue component is dedicated to employee management within an admin central interface. Key functionalities and patterns include:

*   **User Management:** It allows for adding new users via a dedicated form (`<AddNew>`) and provides a comprehensive view of existing employees.
*   **Search and Filtering:** Employees can be searched by name or tags using a `v-text-field`. An advanced search feature (`mdi-account-filter-outline`) allows filtering by various attributes such as employee ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, date of joining (DOJ), and last working day (LWD). Active filters are displayed as `v-chip` components.
*   **Employee Statistics:** The component displays statistics on male and female employees, including their counts and calculated percentages.
*   **Administrative Actions:** Several actions are available through buttons and icons, including "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", and "Download Database". The "Download Database" feature is notably implemented with custom SVG icons.
*   **UI Framework:** The component heavily utilizes Vuetify, evident from the use of `v-card`, `v-card-title`, `v-img`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-tooltip`, and `v-chip` for its layout and interactive elements.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The interface dynamically switches between the "Add New User" form and the employee listing/management view based on an `addUserFlag`.

The overall pattern indicates a focus on robust employee data management, including input, search, statistical analysis, and administrative tools within the `hecqatar-admin` application.

## 11:46:44
The provided log details changes across two projects: `hecqatar-api` and `hecqatar-admin`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-api/.env`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `24/10/2025, 09:16:35` and `24/10/2025, 09:35:56`
    *   **Summary:** As this is an `.env` file, its content is not summarized to protect sensitive information such as database URLs, AWS keys, API keys, and various other configuration secrets. The timestamps indicate two distinct updates to the environment variables within a short period.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**
    *   **Initial significant change at `24/10/2025, 10:43:41`:** This Vue component manages employee information and includes functionality for:
        *   Adding new users via an `AddNew` component.
        *   Displaying employee statistics, including male and female employee counts and percentages.
        *   A search bar for filtering employees by name or tags.
        *   Action buttons for "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", and "Download Database". The "Download Database" button features a custom SVG icon.
        *   An "Advance Search" tooltip to expand a filter form.
        *   A section displaying active filters as chips for various criteria (ID, Status, Name, Email, Designation, Department, Cost Center, Job Group, Team, Date of Joining, Last Working Day).
    *   **Subsequent timestamps (`24/10/2025, 10:47:28`, `10:47:50`, `10:58:25`, `10:58:38`, `10:59:40`, `11:04:47`, `11:19:47`):** The code content for this file remained identical across these multiple commits, suggesting minor saves or non-functional changes were made.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/pages/user/profile/index.vue`**
    *   **Initial significant change at `24/10/2025, 11:23:57`:** This Vue page displays a user's profile and includes:
        *   A left-hand card showing user status, employee ID, avatar, name, designation, and contact details (email, phone, WhatsApp). It also has a dedicated "Personal" section for personal contact information and displays the user's reporting manager, along with a "Change Password" link.
        *   The right-hand section features cards for "Your Bio", "Personal Information", and "Emergency Contact," all with edit buttons based on component visibility and editability.
        *   A "Dependents" section that initially contained a typo "Dependentssss" in its title, and lists sponsored dependents in a `v-data-table`. This table displays details such as name, relationship, gender, Qatar ID and passport information (including expiry dates, with QID and passport numbers being clickable links to show images of documents), and an "Edit" button for each dependent.
    *   **Correction at `24/10/2025, 11:24:41`:** The typo "Dependentssss" in the "Dependents" section title was corrected to "Dependents".
    *   **Subsequent timestamps (`24/10/2025, 11:28:37`, `11:30:29`, `11:45:50`):** The code content for this file remained identical after the typo correction across these multiple commits.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Identical Commits:** A notable pattern is the presence of several consecutive commits with identical code content for the `.vue` files (`employment.vue` and `index.vue`). This often indicates minor, non-functional edits (e.g., whitespace changes, reformatting, or saving without substantial code alterations) that were logged as distinct changes.
*   **Focus on Employee Management and User Profiles:** Changes are concentrated on features related to employee administration (`employment.vue`) and detailed user profile management (`index.vue`), including search, filtering, adding users, and displaying various personal and dependent information.
*   **Component-Based UI Development:** The use of Vue components (`AddNew`, `EditPDF`, `v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-chip`, `v-tooltip`) is consistent across the UI-related files, indicating a component-driven development approach.
*   **Emphasis on Data Display and Editing:** Both `.vue` files show a clear focus on displaying structured data and providing mechanisms for editing (e.g., `editInfo`, `editDependent`).
*   **Styling Consistency:** Recurring styling attributes like `borderRadiusCards`, `eventCard`, `box-shadow`, and specific color classes (`darkBlue-heading-text`, `blue-heading-text`) suggest a consistent design system.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Extensive use of `v-if` directives for rendering sections or components based on flags (`addUserFlag`, `emp_cards`, `isComponentVisible`, `isSectionCheck`) or data availability (`user.personal`, `user.sponsored_dependents`).

## 12:46:53
The provided log details changes across two distinct application components and one configuration file, spanning from 09:16:35 to 11:48:41 on October 24, 2025.

**File Path: `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**
*   **Initial State (24/10/2025, 10:43:41):** This Vue component outlines the "Employment" section of an admin panel. It features a conditional interface for adding new users (`addUserFlag`). The main view includes a search bar, displays for male and female employee counts with their respective percentages, and a series of action buttons for "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", and "Download Database". An "Advance Search" functionality is present, allowing filtering by employee ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, date of joining (DOJ), and last working day (LWD), with active filters displayed as chips.
*   **Subsequent Changes (24/10/2025, 10:47:28 to 11:48:41):** All subsequent entries for this file show identical content to the initial state. This indicates that no further functional code changes were introduced or saved during this period, or any minor edits were quickly reverted.

**File Path: `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/pages/user/profile/index.vue`**
*   **Initial State (24/10/2025, 11:23:57):** This Vue page renders a detailed user profile. It incorporates a PDF editing component (`EditPDF`) that is conditionally displayed. The profile displays core user information such as status, employee ID, avatar, name, and designation. It also includes contact details (email, phone, WhatsApp) and a dedicated "Personal" section for individual contact information. Key sections like "Your Bio," "Personal Information," and "Emergency Contact" are present, each with an "Edit" button, suggesting configurable visibility and editability. A "Dependents" section is included, designed to display sponsored dependents in a data table format, featuring headers for name, relationship, gender, Qatar ID and Passport details (including expiry), and an edit action. Notably, the initial title for this section was "Dependentssss" (with an extra 's').
*   **Correction (24/10/2025, 11:24:41):** A minor, but significant, textual correction was made in the "Dependents" section, changing its title from "Dependentssss" to "Dependents".
*   **Subsequent Changes (24/10/2025, 11:28:37 and 11:30:29):** The content for these timestamps is identical to the corrected version at 11:24:41, indicating no further code alterations within this timeframe.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
Both `.vue` files exhibit a consistent UI structure leveraging Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-btn`, `v-img`, `v-chip`, `v-data-table`, `v-tooltip`) for layout, data display, and user interaction. There's a recurring pattern of displaying user-related information, offering search/filter capabilities, and providing edit/action buttons. The consistent use of specific SVG images (e.g., `/hr/claim.svg`, `/profile/edit.svg`) suggests a shared asset library or design system. Multiple identical logs for a single file suggest frequent saving without functional changes or quick reverts of minor edits.

## 13:46:55
The provided log details changes across two distinct Vue application files and one environment configuration file.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-api/.env`**:
    *   This file contains environment variables and appears in the log at `24/10/2025, 09:16:35` and `24/10/2025, 09:35:56`. As per the instructions, sensitive environment configuration files are excluded from the summary.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**:
    *   **Initial State (24/10/2025, 10:43:41)**: This Vue component outlines the administrative interface for managing employee data. It features a conditional display for either an "Add New User" form or the main employee listing. The main listing includes a search bar, statistics for male and female employees (with counts and percentages), and various action buttons: "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", and "Download Database" (represented by an SVG icon). An "Advance Search" toggle and dynamic filter chips (for employee ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, date of joining, and last working day) are also present.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (from 10:47:28 to 11:48:41)**: All subsequent entries for this file show identical code content, indicating no functional or structural modifications were introduced, committed, or recorded in the log during this period.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/pages/user/profile/index.vue`**:
    *   **Initial State (24/10/2025, 11:23:57)**: This Vue page component defines the user profile interface. It conditionally renders an `EditPDF` component. The main profile displays user details such as status, employee ID, avatar, full name, designation, and contact information (email, phone, WhatsApp, and personal contact details). It also shows the reporting manager and a "Change Password" link. Structured sections are present for "Your Bio", "Personal Information", "Emergency Contact", and a "Dependentssss" section. The dependents section uses a `v-data-table` to list sponsored dependents, providing details like name, relationship, gender, Qatar ID expiry, Qatar ID and passport ID (both clickable to show associated documents), passport expiry, and an "Edit" button for each dependent. An "Add Dependent" button is also available.
    *   **Key Change (24/10/2025, 11:24:41)**: A minor but notable correction was made in the "Dependentssss" section title, which was updated to "Dependents", fixing a typographical error.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (from 11:28:37 to 11:30:29)**: The code content remains identical across these later timestamps, suggesting no further alterations were logged for this file after the typo correction.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **24/10/2025, 10:43:41**: Initial commit/log of the `employment.vue` component structure.
*   **24/10/2025, 11:23:57**: Initial commit/log of the `user/profile/index.vue` page structure.
*   **24/10/2025, 11:24:41**: Correction of a typo in the "Dependents" section title within `user/profile/index.vue`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vuetify Framework Usage**: Both `.vue` files heavily utilize Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-img`, `v-text-field`, `v-chip`, `v-tooltip`, `v-data-table`). This indicates a consistent use of Vuetify for UI development across the `hecqatar-admin` project.
*   **Conditional Rendering**: Extensive use of `v-if` directives for conditional display of components, sections, and even individual data points (e.g., based on `addUserFlag`, `emp_cards`, `isComponentVisible`, `isSectionCheck`). This suggests a dynamic and permissions-aware user interface.
*   **Styling Consistency**: Repeated use of classes like `borderRadiusCards`, `eventCard`, `rounded-xl`, `darkBlue-heading-text`, `subHeadingFontSize`, `textFontSize` points to a well-defined and consistently applied design system.
*   **Data Binding and Filters**: Usage of `v-model` for search inputs and filters (`filterSearch` object), and custom filters (`| truncateText`, `| formatDDMY`), demonstrates structured data handling and presentation.
*   **Repeated Log Entries**: A recurring pattern is the logging of identical file content multiple times over a short period (e.g., for `employment.vue` and `user/profile/index.vue`). This could be due to automated save actions, frequent but uncommitted changes, or a logging system that captures file states without detecting content differences.

## 14:42:20
The log details changes across two main types of Vue components: `requests.vue` (under `admin-central` and `team-central` directories) and `LetterTemplate.vue` (under `configurations`). The changes occurred on October 24, 2025, with several closely timed updates for each file.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue`**
This file, observed at 13:56:32, 13:56:57, 13:57:15, and 13:57:29, shows no functional or structural changes across these timestamps. The component serves as a central hub for administrators to manage various employee requests, including Leave, Lieu, Work From Home (WFH), Passport Safekeep, Loan, Claim, Attendance, Letters, Salary Adjustment, Salary Advance, and Trips. It dynamically renders specific `Create...` components (e.g., `CreateLeaves`, `ClaimRequest`) based on the selected request type. Employee selection is handled via `v-autocomplete` components. The interface also provides a view for "All Requests" or "All Pending Requests" with a search function, and a separate section for "support" requests that includes a search and select functionality. The `userType` prop passed to most sub-components is consistently `'ADMIN'`.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/team-central/requests.vue`**
Updated at 13:59:03, this component is structurally similar to its `admin-central` counterpart but features notable distinctions:
- **Styling and Layout:** The "Select Request Type" `v-select` component had its class updated to include `mt-5`, suggesting a margin-top adjustment. The layout for the card title, specifically the "All Requests" section, adjusted column widths from `cols="6"` and `cols="4"` to `cols="5"` and `cols="5"` respectively, and introduced a `v-spacer`.
- **User Role Context:** The `userType` prop for most request creation sub-components (e.g., `CreateLeaves`, `CreateTimeOffLieu`, `CreateWfh`, `ClaimRequest`, `LetterRequest`, `CreateSalaryAdjustment`) was explicitly changed to `'MANAGER'`, differentiating it from the admin version.
- **Component Specific Props:** The `LetterRequest` component now receives a `teamCentral="true"` prop instead of `adminCentral="true"`.
- **Increased Scrollable Area:** The `max-height` and `min-height` for the main request list's scrollable div were increased from `620px` to `790px`.
- **Support Request Enhancements:** The "support" filter section was expanded to include a dropdown for sorting tickets by status (All, New, In Progress, Resolved, Cancelled) via a `selectedSort` model, and a condition `tickets.length > 0` along with a `tick-holder` class, indicating a more robust display for support tickets.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue`**
This file, observed at 13:59:41, 14:20:38, and 14:20:55, also shows no functional or structural changes across these timestamps. It manages the configuration of letter templates, offering tabs to "CREATE NEW LETTER", "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER", and "Letter Key Hints".
- **Letter Creation/Update Features:** Both new and existing letter configurations support defining a `requestType`, `requestSubType` (for "NOC" letters), `category` (multiple selection), `dateFormat`, and options for "Allow request for hard copy" and "Show in Team Calendar".
- **Request Limiting:** A significant feature is the ability to "Limit the number of requests", which includes fields for `limit_period`, `request_limit`, and `limit_exceeded_action` to control how frequently and how many times a specific letter type can be requested.
- **Previews and Actions:** For existing letters, the component provides buttons for "PDF Preview" and "Before Approve Preview" (utilizing the `CreateLetter` component within dialogs), as well as options to "Update Request" and "Delete Letter Template".

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Vuetify Components:** The log heavily features Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-select`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-switch`, `v-tooltip`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-dialog`, `v-tabs`, `v-tab`, `v-tab-item`, `v-list`, `v-list-item-group`, `v-divider`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-date-picker`), indicating a consistent UI framework.
- **Employee-Centric Operations:** Both `requests.vue` files frequently involve selecting employees via `v-autocomplete` and passing `selectedEmp` or `fetchedEmployee` props to child components, suggesting a common pattern for employee-specific request handling.
- **Dynamic Component Loading:** The `v-if` directive is extensively used to conditionally render various request-specific components or UI sections based on `requestType` or other state variables like `createRequest`.
- **Data Fetching:** The `@change="fetchUserInfo()"` and `@input="searchFn()"` event handlers indicate active data fetching and filtering mechanisms.
- **Date Formatting and Request Limits:** The `LetterTemplate.vue` shows a recurring need to configure date formats and apply request limits, highlighting configurable aspects of the application.
- **User Type Differentiation:** The `userType` prop (`'ADMIN'` vs. `'MANAGER'`) consistently passed to child components signifies a clear distinction in functionalities or permissions based on user roles within the system.
