The primary update observed involves the `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` file, with a significant change recorded at **24/10/2025, 10:43:41**.

This Vue component is dedicated to employee management within an admin central interface. Key functionalities and patterns include:

*   **User Management:** It allows for adding new users via a dedicated form (`<AddNew>`) and provides a comprehensive view of existing employees.
*   **Search and Filtering:** Employees can be searched by name or tags using a `v-text-field`. An advanced search feature (`mdi-account-filter-outline`) allows filtering by various attributes such as employee ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, date of joining (DOJ), and last working day (LWD). Active filters are displayed as `v-chip` components.
*   **Employee Statistics:** The component displays statistics on male and female employees, including their counts and calculated percentages.
*   **Administrative Actions:** Several actions are available through buttons and icons, including "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", and "Download Database". The "Download Database" feature is notably implemented with custom SVG icons.
*   **UI Framework:** The component heavily utilizes Vuetify, evident from the use of `v-card`, `v-card-title`, `v-img`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-tooltip`, and `v-chip` for its layout and interactive elements.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The interface dynamically switches between the "Add New User" form and the employee listing/management view based on an `addUserFlag`.

The overall pattern indicates a focus on robust employee data management, including input, search, statistical analysis, and administrative tools within the `hecqatar-admin` application.
