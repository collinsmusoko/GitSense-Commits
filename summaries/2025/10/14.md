# Activity Summary for 14/10/2025

## 09:52:45
The provided log details a series of changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`. All modifications occurred on October 14, 2025, within a span of approximately 40 minutes, suggesting a focused session of updates and corrections.

Key updates include:

*   **14/10/2025, 09:27:40**: A minor textual correction was made in the advanced search filter section. The label "Filter byyyyyyy:" was shortened to "Filter by:".
*   **14/10/2025, 09:29:18**: A temporary and seemingly accidental textual change was introduced, altering the "Download Database" tooltip text to "Download Databaseeeeeed".
*   **14/10/2025, 09:30:15**: The "Download Database" tooltip text was immediately reverted to its correct "Download Database" value, fixing the previous typo.
*   **14/10/2025, 09:48:30**: A significant change to the visibility logic of the "Bulk Bank Details Upload" feature was implemented. The `v-if` condition was updated from `isManager == 'false'` to `isManager == 'false' && !isUserAManager`. This means the button will now only be visible if the user is explicitly *not* a manager and also if the `isUserAManager` flag (presumably a separate check) is false, tightening access control for this function.
*   **14/10/2025, 09:48:50**: The content for this timestamp is identical to the previous entry, indicating either no functional code change in the visible snippet or merely a save operation.

The recurring patterns involve small, iterative adjustments to UI text and refinements in conditional rendering logic, particularly for administrative actions like bulk data management and advanced search filtering.
