# Activity Summary for 10/10/2025

The file `/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` was significantly updated on **10/10/2025, 11:19:22**.

This update introduces a comprehensive `LoginForm` component written in TypeScript, utilizing React hooks (`useState`, `useRouter`), Next.js navigation, and Redux for state management (specifically `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` with `login` and `clearError` actions from `authSlice`).

Key changes and features include:
*   **Authentication Logic**: The form handles user input for username and password. Upon submission, it dispatches a `login` action to the Redux store.
*   **Role-Based Redirection**: After successful login, the application redirects the user to different dashboards based on their assigned role: `/user/home` for 'admin', `/users/dashboard2` for 'moderator', `/users/dashboard3` for 'writer', and `/users/dashboard1` as a default fallback.
*   **Error Handling**: It integrates error display from the Redux `auth` slice, showing a styled error message if authentication fails, and clears the error when the user starts typing again.
*   **Loading State**: The login button dynamically displays a loading spinner and changes its appearance when the login process is in progress (`loading` state from Redux).
*   **Rich UI/UX Design**: The component features an extensive and visually detailed layout built with Tailwind CSS.
    *   It adopts a two-column design for larger screens, showcasing "Tell A Tale Media" branding with pink color accents (`#FF6CB5`, `pink-400`) and a display image on the left, and the login form on the right.
    *   Distinctive design elements include a background image for the form's upper section, an overlaid company name, and a floating circular logo icon positioned on the form.
    *   It also includes a "Sign in with Username" button (though the actual implementation uses the provided username/password fields), a separator, and input fields with leading SVG icons for username and password.
    *   A "Forgot Password?" link is present, though its functionality isn't detailed in this log.

Overall, the update delivers a fully functional and aesthetically designed login experience with robust state management and role-based access redirection.
