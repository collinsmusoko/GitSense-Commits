# Activity Summary for 10/10/2025

## 11:56:53
The file `/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` was significantly updated on **10/10/2025, 11:19:22**.

This update introduces a comprehensive `LoginForm` component written in TypeScript, utilizing React hooks (`useState`, `useRouter`), Next.js navigation, and Redux for state management (specifically `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` with `login` and `clearError` actions from `authSlice`).

Key changes and features include:
*   **Authentication Logic**: The form handles user input for username and password. Upon submission, it dispatches a `login` action to the Redux store.
*   **Role-Based Redirection**: After successful login, the application redirects the user to different dashboards based on their assigned role: `/user/home` for 'admin', `/users/dashboard2` for 'moderator', `/users/dashboard3` for 'writer', and `/users/dashboard1` as a default fallback.
*   **Error Handling**: It integrates error display from the Redux `auth` slice, showing a styled error message if authentication fails, and clears the error when the user starts typing again.
*   **Loading State**: The login button dynamically displays a loading spinner and changes its appearance when the login process is in progress (`loading` state from Redux).
*   **Rich UI/UX Design**: The component features an extensive and visually detailed layout built with Tailwind CSS.
    *   It adopts a two-column design for larger screens, showcasing "Tell A Tale Media" branding with pink color accents (`#FF6CB5`, `pink-400`) and a display image on the left, and the login form on the right.
    *   Distinctive design elements include a background image for the form's upper section, an overlaid company name, and a floating circular logo icon positioned on the form.
    *   It also includes a "Sign in with Username" button (though the actual implementation uses the provided username/password fields), a separator, and input fields with leading SVG icons for username and password.
    *   A "Forgot Password?" link is present, though its functionality isn't detailed in this log.

Overall, the update delivers a fully functional and aesthetically designed login experience with robust state management and role-based access redirection.

All recorded changes pertain to the `/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` file, with updates occurring between 10/10/2025, 13:37:38 and 10/10/2025, 13:44:06.

**File-Specific Updates for `/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`**:

The `LoginForm.tsx` component is a client-side React component built with Next.js navigation and Redux Toolkit for state management and authentication.

**Initial State (Consistent from 13:37:38 to 13:38:47):**
*   **Functionality:** It implements a login form with username and password fields. It uses `useState` for form data, `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` to interact with a Redux `authSlice` for `login` and `clearError` actions, and `useRouter` for navigation.
    *   The `handleChange` function updates form data and clears any Redux-stored error messages when the user starts typing.
    *   The `handleSubmit` function dispatches the `login` action with `formData`. Upon successful login, it redirects the user to the `/dashboard` route. Error handling is primarily managed within the Redux slice.
    *   A loading state (`loading`) from Redux disables the submit button and displays a spinning "Signing in..." animation.
*   **UI/Styling:** The component features a visually styled two-column layout for larger screens, with a "Tell A Tale Media" branding section on the left and the login form on the right.
    *   The form area includes a stylized header with a background image, company name overlay, and a prominent circular logo.
    *   A "SIGN IN WITH USERNAME" button (which does not appear to be functionally tied to the form submission in the provided code, acting more as a visual placeholder or alternative) is present, followed by an "Or" divider.
    *   Error messages from the Redux state are displayed prominently with a red background and an SVG icon.
    *   Input fields for "Username*" and "Password*" include leading SVG icons and styling for focus states.
    *   A "Forgot Password?" button is present but not implemented.

**Significant Change (Introduced at 13:42:21):**
*   The primary functional change occurred where the post-login redirect path was updated. Previously, successful login redirected users to `router.push('/dashboard')`. This was changed to `router.push('/user/home')`. The accompanying comment was also updated to reflect this change, stating that "Role-based access control will be handled within the home page."

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   Throughout all log entries, the core structure, Redux integration, and extensive Tailwind CSS styling of the `LoginForm.tsx` component remained consistent.
*   The primary recurring element is the identical content across most of the initial timestamps, indicating minor or no changes were saved, until a specific functional update was committed at 13:42:21. The subsequent log entry at 13:44:06 also showed no further changes from the 13:42:21 update.
*   The use of Redux for authentication (`login`, `clearError`, `loading`, `error`) and `next/navigation` for routing are consistent patterns in this component.
