# Activity Summary for 22/10/2025

## 09:00:15
The provided log details changes across two distinct file paths, all occurring on October 22, 2025, within a roughly twenty-minute window, indicating a focused development session.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`**
    *   This Vue component, responsible for the team central shift management interface, was logged repeatedly with identical content between 08:39:22 and 08:59:41.
    *   **Content Overview**: The component features extensive UI elements for managing shift schedules, including:
        *   A "Bulk Upload Shift Schedule" dialog with functionality to download an Excel template, upload an Excel file, and display errors.
        *   A main shift calendar view, allowing navigation by month, filtering by work location and department, and displaying shifts.
        *   Toolbar actions for shift lock, shift logs, bulk upload for specific users, and general bulk upload.
        *   A "Shift Roster" dialog providing detailed information for each shift, including start/end times and total hours, with special handling for "off" shifts.
        *   Dialogs to display event details (individual shift information, including assigned team members with their avatars and emails) and a "More Events" dialog for days with multiple shifts.
        *   Heavy reliance on Vuetify components (`v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-tooltip`, `v-select`, `v-calendar`, `v-avatar`, etc.).
        *   Extensive use of internationalization (`$t`) for text labels.
    *   **Changes**: Based *solely on the provided code snippets*, there are no observable content changes in this file across the various timestamps. The entries seem to capture the state of the file at different save points, implying either no changes to this specific template section, or changes in other parts of the component (e.g., script, style) not included in the log.

*   **`/response_0c418b5f-2241-450e-9eee-ae74bf917e35/3`**
    *   This entry, timestamped 22/10/2025, 08:50:53, shows an update to a `data()` block of a Vue component.
    *   **Specific Update**: A new data property, `specific_users_upload_dialog`, was introduced and initialized to `false`. A previously commented-out property `assignShiftDialog` was also noted, with an instruction to remove it if unused. This indicates the component is being prepared to manage the visibility of a dialog related to specific user uploads.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **22/10/2025, 08:50:53**: Introduction of the `specific_users_upload_dialog` data property in a Vue component's data block.
*   All other timestamps for `shift.vue` (08:39:22, 08:47:52, 08:52:33, 08:53:01, 08:55:20, 08:56:16, 08:57:29, 08:59:25, 08:59:41) show consistent content, suggesting either no functional changes to the visible template or frequent saves during an active editing session.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue.js Development**: The file paths, `.vue` extension, `<template>` and `data()` blocks, and Vuetify component usage strongly indicate development within a Vue.js framework.
*   **UI/UX Focus**: Many changes involve dialogs and interactive elements (`v-dialog`, `v-tooltip`, `v-btn`), suggesting a focus on enhancing user interaction and information display.
*   **Shift Management**: The `shift.vue` component's content clearly points to a system for managing employee shift schedules, including viewing, filtering, and bulk uploading shifts.
*   **Internationalization**: The consistent use of `$t('my_team.myTeam_...')` indicates that the application supports multiple languages, with all user-facing strings externalized for translation.
*   **Calendar and Filtering**: The presence of `v-calendar` and filter options for location and department highlights the importance of schedule visualization and targeted data retrieval.

## 10:00:19
The provided log details code changes across two distinct entries, primarily focusing on a Vue.js component related to team shift management.

**File-specific Updates and Timestamps:**

*   **/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue**: This file, a Vue.js component, was modified and saved extensively between 08:39:22 and 09:32:36 on 22/10/2025. Despite numerous timestamps, the provided code snippet for this file remains identical across all entries. This indicates either very minor non-functional changes (e.g., whitespace, comments, or reformatting not captured in the snippet) or no functional changes to this specific section during this period. The component's purpose is to manage and display employee shift schedules within a "team-central" section of an admin application. It features a bulk upload dialog for shift schedules, a calendar view for shifts, filtering options by work location and department, and dialogs to view individual shift details and more events on a given date.
*   **/response_0c418b5f-2241-450e-9eee-ae74bf917e35/3**: This entry, logged at 08:50:53 on 22/10/2025, appears to be a directive or an internal note regarding component data properties. It explicitly states to remove `assignShiftDialog` if unused and to retain `specific_users_upload_dialog`. This represents a logical change in the component's internal state management, clarifying which data properties are actively needed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Saves Without Content Change**: The most notable pattern is the high frequency of identical `shift.vue` file saves within a short timeframe (over 18 entries in roughly an hour), despite the provided code content remaining constant. This suggests a developer was actively working on this component, perhaps making small changes not captured in the log snippets, or frequently saving their work.
*   **Shift Management Features**: The `shift.vue` component consistently focuses on comprehensive shift management. Key functionalities include:
    *   **Bulk Upload**: A dedicated dialog for uploading shift schedules via Excel files, including template download, file input, error display, and upload actions.
    *   **Calendar View**: A `v-calendar` component to display shifts by month, with navigation for previous/next periods and a loading indicator.
    *   **Shift Information and Interaction**: Buttons and tooltips for "shift lock", "shift logs", "bulk upload for specific users", and a general "bulk upload." An "information" icon opens a "shift roster" dialog.
    *   **Filtering**: An expandable filter form allows filtering shifts by `workLocation` and `department`.
    *   **Shift Details Display**: Dialogs (`eventDialog`, `moreEventsDialog`) for viewing detailed shift information, including start/end times (with support for split shifts via `start_time2`, `end_time2`), total hours, and assigned team members with their image, name, and email. Special handling is included for "off" shifts.
*   **Localization Support**: The use of `$t()` throughout the template (e.g., `$t('my_team.myTeam_select_excel_file')`) indicates the application supports internationalization.
*   **Vuetify Component Usage**: The extensive use of Vuetify components (`v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-file-input`, `v-alert`, `v-select`, `v-calendar`, `v-avatar`, `v-chip`, `v-tooltip`, `v-expand-transition`) is a strong recurring pattern, highlighting a consistent UI framework.
*   **Specific User Image Placeholder**: The `v-avatar` component consistently uses a default placeholder image (`https://nathanhroperations.s3.amazonaws.com/profile_pics/Sahiba_T/avatar-7.png`) if a user's `image_url` is empty.

## 11:00:16
The log details changes across two primary contexts: a Vue component file and a data properties snippet.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue:** This file represents a Vue.js component (`shift.vue`) primarily responsible for displaying and managing a team's shift schedule.
    *   It features a calendar interface (`v-calendar`) to visualize shifts.
    *   Includes functionality for "Bulk Upload Shift Schedule" through a dialog, allowing users to download a template and upload an Excel file. This dialog provides error messages and tracks upload status.
    *   Contains a "Shift Roster" dialog that lists defined shifts, showing their names, abbreviations, colors, start/end times, and total hours, with special handling for "off" shifts.
    *   Provides filtering options based on work location and department within an expandable form.
    *   Includes actions for shift locking, viewing shift logs, bulk uploading for specific users, and manual shift editing.
    *   Shift event details shown in a dialog include employee information (avatar, name, email) for the assigned team, and comprehensive time details for both regular and split shifts.
    *   All entries for this file (from `08:39:22` to `10:43:05` on `22/10/2025`) show identical code content, suggesting that no functional or structural changes were committed or logged for this specific component during this period, or that any changes were superficial (e.g., whitespace) and not reflected in the provided code blocks.

*   **/response_0c418b5f-2241-450e-9eee-ae74bf917e35/3:** This entry, appearing at `22/10/2025, 08:50:53`, indicates a modification within a `data()` method, likely of a Vue component. The change involves commenting out a data property `assignShiftDialog` (suggesting it might be deprecated or no longer needed) and explicitly retaining another property, `specific_users_upload_dialog`, which controls the visibility of a "specific users upload" dialog.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The `shift.vue` component's structure and functionality were initially captured at `22/10/2025, 08:39:22`.
*   A data property definition was explicitly modified or clarified at `22/10/2025, 08:50:53`.
*   Subsequent timestamps for `shift.vue` (e.g., `08:47:52`, `08:52:33`, `08:53:01`, `08:55:20`, `08:56:16`, `08:57:29`, `08:59:25`, `08:59:41`, `09:00:20`, `09:11:26`, `09:14:28`, `09:19:13`, `09:24:50`, `09:25:10`, `09:31:00`, `09:31:26`, `09:31:59`, `09:32:08`, `09:32:24`, `09:32:36`, `10:38:19`, `10:41:04`, `10:42:16`, `10:43:05`) indicate repeated logging of the same component state, rather than distinct functional changes within the provided code.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vuetify UI Components:** Extensive use of Vuetify components (`v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-icon`, `v-btn`, `v-tooltip`, `v-img`, `v-select`, `v-calendar`, `v-avatar`, `v-chip`) for a rich and consistent user interface.
*   **Internationalization:** Consistent use of `$t()` for text content (e.g., `my_team.myTeam_select_excel_file`), indicating support for multiple languages.
*   **Dialog-Based Interactions:** Many key features (Bulk Upload, Shift Roster, Event Details) are implemented using dialog components.
*   **Calendar View:** The `v-calendar` component is central to the `shift.vue` functionality, allowing navigation and event display.
*   **Shift Detail Handling:** Recurring logic for displaying shift times (`start_time`, `end_time`) and total hours, with specific conditional rendering for "off" shifts and "split shifts" (using `_time2`, `_hours2` properties).
*   **Redundant Logging:** A notable pattern is the high frequency of identical code logs for `shift.vue` across numerous timestamps, suggesting either automated logging of states or very minor, unlogged modifications between saves.

## 13:00:22
The log primarily details changes across two distinct file paths: `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue` and `/response_0c418b5f-2241-450e-9eee-ae74bf917e35/3`.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`**: This file, a Vue component, appears to have undergone numerous saves or minor, non-functional changes that do not alter the visible code content across the provided log entries. The content consistently describes a comprehensive shift management interface within a "Team Central" module. Key features include:
    *   A **Bulk Upload Shift Schedule** dialog, allowing users to download a template, select an Excel file (``.xlsx``, ``.xls``), and upload shifts, with error handling and loading indicators.
    *   A main calendar view (`v-calendar`) to display shift events, showing the event title and the number of team members assigned.
    *   Navigation controls (previous/next buttons) for the calendar and a loading indicator.
    *   Toolbar actions including "Shift Lock," "Shift Logs," "Bulk Upload for Specific Users," and "Bulk Upload" (the same as the dialog mentioned above).
    *   An informational **Shift Roster** dialog that lists various shifts with their names, abbreviations, colors, and detailed start/end times and total hours (including special handling for "off" shifts).
    *   A filter section (`v-expand-transition`) to filter shifts by work location and department.
    *   Dialogs for displaying individual event details (shift name, times, and a list of assigned employees with their avatars, names, and emails) and for showing "more events" on a specific date, encouraging users to click for details.
    *   Buttons for "Edit" (if `teamView` is true) and to trigger a "manualShift" creation.

*   **`/response_0c418b5f-2241-450e-9eee-ae74bf917e35/3`**: This entry describes an update to a `data()` method within a component. Specifically, a property `assignShiftDialog` was commented out with a note to remove it if unused, while `specific_users_upload_dialog` was explicitly retained. This indicates a refactoring effort to manage component state more efficiently, likely removing unused variables.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   The only code modification recorded in the log, distinct from repetitive content, is for `/response_0c418b5f-2241-450e-9eee-ae74bf917e35/3` at **22/10/2025, 08:50:53**.
*   For `shift.vue`, despite many entries between **22/10/2025, 08:39:22** and **22/10/2025, 12:12:19**, the visible code content remains identical, suggesting these timestamps represent non-substantive saves or other changes not reflected in the provided code snippets.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

*   **Vuetify Framework Usage**: The `shift.vue` component heavily relies on Vuetify for its UI, utilizing components like `v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-tooltip`, `v-calendar`, `v-select`, `v-file-input`, and `v-alert`.
*   **Internationalization**: Extensive use of `$t()` function calls (e.g., `$t('my_team.myTeam_upload')`) indicates the application supports multiple languages.
*   **Shift Scheduling and Management**: The component is designed for comprehensive shift management, including bulk operations, calendar visualization, and detailed shift information display.
*   **State Management Hints**: The explicit commenting and retention of `data` properties in `/response_.../3` suggest adherence to best practices for component state, aiming for clarity and avoiding unused variables.
*   **Repetitive Saves/Minor Changes**: The numerous identical entries for `shift.vue` over several hours could indicate frequent saves during development, perhaps for minor adjustments not reflected in the provided snippets, or automated saves by an IDE.

## 13:20:29
The log details a series of snapshots of the file `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue` between 22/10/2025, 12:49:58 and 13:08:23. Despite multiple entries, the content of the file remains identical across all recorded timestamps, suggesting either no actual functional changes were committed, or only very minor, non-semantic adjustments were made that aren't reflected in the provided code snippets, or the log captures periodic saves of an unchanged file.

The file itself is a Vue.js component designed for configuring and managing letter templates within an administrative panel.

Key functionalities and patterns observed in the component:

*   **Loading State:** Displays a loading spinner (`v-progress-circular`) while `configDataLoaded` is false.
*   **Letter Editing Modes:** Integrates a `CreateLetter` component, which is conditionally rendered based on `letteredit`, `lettereditbefore`, or `letterAdd` flags, suggesting different states or types of letter creation/editing (e.g., standard edit, pre-approval edit, new letter addition).
*   **Tabbed Interface:** Utilizes `v-tabs` to organize the interface into three main sections:
    *   **CREATE NEW LETTER:** For defining new letter templates.
    *   **CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER:** For selecting and managing existing templates.
    *   **Letter Key Hints:** A tab that exists in the UI but whose content related to "Letter Key Hints" is largely commented out in the provided code, indicating it might be a planned, deprecated, or in-progress feature.
*   **Letter Configuration Forms:** Both "CREATE NEW LETTER" and "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER" tabs contain forms that allow users to configure various aspects of a letter request:
    *   **Letter Type:** Users can select an existing type or define a new one.
    *   **Letter Sub Type:** Conditional input for `NOC` (No Objection Certificate) letter types.
    *   **Letter Category:** Supports multiple selections of letter categories using `v-select` with `small-chips`.
    *   **Date Format:** Allows selection of a specific date format.
    *   **Request Limiting:** Includes a `v-switch` to enable or disable limiting the number of requests. If enabled, fields for `limit_period` (e.g., number of days, or 'ytd') and `request_limit` (maximum number of requests) become available, along with quick-select `v-chip` options for setting days.
*   **Actions for Existing Letters:** The "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER" section provides buttons for:
    *   Deleting a letter template (with a confirmation dialog).
    *   Updating the letter request.
    *   Previewing the PDF output of the letter.
    *   Previewing the letter before approval.
*   **Vuetify Framework:** The component heavily leverages Vuetify UI components for its structure and styling, including cards, forms, selects, text fields, switches, tooltips, buttons, icons, and dialogs.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Data Binding:** Extensive use of `v-if` for displaying elements based on specific conditions and `v-model` for two-way data binding with form inputs.
*   **Form Validation:** Rules like `genericRule` and `minZeroRules` are applied to form fields, indicating client-side validation is implemented.

## 14:00:20
The provided log primarily details numerous changes to a single Vue component file, `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`, between 08:39:22 and 12:12:19 on October 22, 2025.

**Key Information and File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`**:
    *   This file, representing a Vue component for shift management, underwent frequent modifications throughout the morning of October 22, 2025.
    *   The consistent content across all provided snippets for this file indicates a stable UI structure and functionality, suggesting that the changes were likely minor internal adjustments, script logic updates (not visible in the template snippet), or simple saves during development rather than significant UI overhauls.
    *   **Core Functionality Displayed**: The component integrates a shift calendar, allowing navigation between months. It features a robust bulk upload mechanism for shift schedules, including a template download option and error handling for file uploads.
    *   **Shift Details and Dialogs**: It includes a detailed "Shift Roster" dialog to display shift names, abbreviations, colors, and precise start/end times (including support for split shifts with `start_time2` and `end_time2`), and an "off" shift indicator. There are also dialogs for viewing individual shift events with employee details (avatar, name, email) and a "More Events" dialog for a specific date.
    *   **User Actions & Tools**: The interface provides buttons/icons for "Shift Lock", "Shift Logs", "Bulk Upload for Specific Users", and a general "Bulk Upload" (represented by an Excel icon). There's also an "Advanced Search" filter section that can be expanded, featuring dropdowns for work location and department.
    *   **Styling and Responsiveness**: Recurring classes like `borderRadiusCards`, `textTransformUnset`, and `:style` bindings indicate custom styling and dynamic sizing for UI elements.

*   **`/response_0c418b5f-2241-450e-9eee-ae74bf917e35/3`**:
    *   At 08:50:53 on October 22, 2025, a data initialization snippet was modified. This change explicitly commented out `assignShiftDialog: false` and kept `specific_users_upload_dialog: false`. This indicates a refactoring or cleanup of data properties, specifically managing the visibility state of dialogs, likely removing an unused or deprecated `assignShiftDialog` property while retaining a similar one for specific user uploads.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intensive Development on `shift.vue`**: The high frequency of identical or nearly identical log entries for `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue` over a concentrated period (several hours on the same day) points to active, ongoing development, debugging, or continuous saving within this specific component.
*   **Dialog-centric UI**: The component heavily relies on various `v-dialog` elements for functionalities like bulk uploads, shift roster viewing, and event details, indicating a modular and interactive user experience.
*   **Internationalization**: The use of `$t('my_team.myTeam_...')` suggests that the application supports multiple languages and has integrated internationalization for its UI text.
*   **Calendar and Filtering**: The calendar view is central to the shift management, complemented by filtering capabilities to refine the displayed information.
*   **Consistency**: The overall structure and features of the `shift.vue` component remain remarkably consistent across all its log entries, highlighting a stable design while potential underlying logic or minor presentation tweaks were being applied.

## 14:20:34
The log details changes across two primary code files within a project named "binhendi," specifically related to letter template configurations and letter generation logic. One file, `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/services/letter.service.js`, has been excluded from this summary as it appears to access environment variables potentially storing sensitive keys.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** This file was subject to multiple logged changes between 22/10/2025, 12:49:58 and 22/10/2025, 13:08:23.
    *   **Key Information:** This Vue.js component (`LetterTemplate.vue`) is responsible for managing letter templates within the admin interface. It presents a tabbed interface for "CREATE NEW LETTER," "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER," and "Letter Key Hints."
        *   **Loading State:** Displays a loading spinner while configuration data (`configDataLoaded`) is being fetched.
        *   **Letter Creation/Editing:** Integrates a `CreateLetter` component, allowing users to edit or add new letters, handling different states (`letteredit`, `lettereditbefore`, `letterAdd`).
        *   **"CREATE NEW LETTER" Tab:** Provides a form for defining new letter requests. Users can:
            *   Specify a Letter Type (and Sub Type if the type is 'NOC').
            *   Assign multiple Letter Categories.
            *   Choose a Date format.
            *   Configure request limits: A toggle (`is_limit_required`) allows limiting the number of requests by specifying a `limit_period` (e.g., "ytd" or a number of days selectable via chips) and a `request_limit`.
            *   Includes a "Preview" button and an "Update Request" button to save the letter format.
        *   **"CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER" Tab:** Features for managing existing letter templates, including:
            *   Options to delete a letter template (with a confirmation dialog).
            *   Buttons for "Update Request," "PDF Preview," and "Before Approve Preview."
            *   Similar input fields as the "CREATE NEW LETTER" tab, but presumably pre-filled with existing template data (`selectedLetterRequest`).
        *   **"Letter Key Hints" Tab:** While present as a tab, the content within this section in the provided log is commented out, suggesting it was either a feature under development, temporarily disabled, or an earlier implementation that was refactored. The commented section showed inputs for "Letter Key," "Input type," and "Selector Values."
    *   **Pattern:** All logged changes for this file show the exact same content, implying either trivial saves without functional changes in the provided snippets, or that the relevant changes are not reflected in the provided code blocks, but rather in associated data or script logic not captured here. The structure and functionality remain consistent throughout the observed timestamps.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/helper/letter.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** This file was modified at 22/10/2025, 13:24:54 and 22/10/2025, 13:25:15.
    *   **Key Information:** This JavaScript helper file defines a `Letters` class that encapsulates logic for processing and generating letter content.
        *   **`computeLetterAddressee`:** This method constructs the addressee block of a letter by replacing various placeholders (e.g., `[name]`, `[nationality]`, `[designation]`, `[companyName]`, `[passportIssueDate]`) with actual user and company data. It handles different user fields based on whether it's a new or existing letter request and formats dates using `moment`. Special handling for "Custom Letter Requests" allows direct input for the addressee.
        *   **`computeLetterContent`:** Similar to `computeLetterAddressee`, this method replaces placeholders within the main body of the letter. It includes more detailed financial information like `[totalFixed]` (formatted to two decimal places) and `[salaryInWords]` (capitalized first letter).
        *   **Auxiliary Functions:** Includes helper functions such as `funGetUserName`, `funGetUserTitle` (determining 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Ms.' based on gender and marital status), `funGetCompanyDetails`, and `funGetUserInfo` for extracting relevant data from user and request objects.
        *   **Text Formatting:** The `splitString` method converts newline characters (`\n`) in input strings into HTML `<br/>` tags for proper rendering.
        *   **Letter Workflow (Partial):** Mentions `funWithdrawLetter` (setting request status to 'withdrawn' and updating approval statuses to 'Withdrawn by Employee') and `funApproveLetter` (partially shown, indicating manager approval logic).
    *   **Pattern:** Both logged entries for this file show identical code. The core functionality revolves around dynamically populating letter templates with user-specific and request-specific data, including personal details, employment information, and financial figures, with a robust system for placeholder replacement.

**Overall Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

*   **Letter Management Focus:** The changes indicate a strong focus on a system for creating, updating, and previewing various types of letters (e.g., NOCs, custom letters) within an administrative context.
*   **Dynamic Content Generation:** Both the frontend Vue component and the backend JavaScript helper emphasize dynamic content generation by replacing placeholders in templates with actual data. This suggests a flexible system for customizing letters without hardcoding content.
*   **Request Limiting:** The frontend includes functionality to limit the number of requests a user can make for a specific letter type, indicating a control mechanism for administrative efficiency or policy enforcement.
*   **Preview Functionality:** Multiple preview options (general preview, PDF preview, before approval preview) highlight the importance of visual verification before final generation or approval.
*   **Backend Logic for Data Integration:** The backend `letter.js` heavily relies on integrating user (`obj_userInfo`), letter template (`obj_letterInfo`), and request-specific (`obj_requestInfo`) data to fill out templates.
*   **Third-party Libraries:** Use of `moment` for date handling and `number-to-words` for text conversion suggests practical utilities for common letter generation needs.
*   **Consistent UI Elements:** The Vue component consistently uses Vuetify components like `v-card`, `v-tabs`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-switch`, `v-btn`, and `v-tooltip` for a uniform user experience.

## 15:00:25
**File: `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`**

    -   A general "Bulk Upload" button (`mdi-microsoft-excel`).
    -   An "information" icon (`mdi-information`) to open a **Shift Roster dialog**, which lists available shifts, their abbreviations, colors, start/end times, and total hours, specifically handling "off" shifts.
-   Action buttons for "Edit" (if `teamView` is active) and "Add" a manual shift (`/directory/add_plus.svg`).
-   Dialogs to display detailed information about a selected shift event, including assigned team members (avatar, name, email), and to list multiple events for a specific date.

At **22/10/2025, 08:50:53**, a change was recorded in a `data()` function. This update involved commenting out an existing data property, `assignShiftDialog`, and introducing a new property, `specific_users_upload_dialog`, initialized to `false`. This indicates a refactoring of state management, possibly renaming a dialog's control variable or separating concerns related to different upload functionalities.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The log entries predominantly feature Vue.js component (`.vue`) code, heavily utilizing Vuetify UI components (`v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-select`, `v-calendar`, `v-tooltip`, etc.). A consistent theme across the UI elements is the implementation of modal dialogs for various interactions (uploading, viewing details, roster information). Internationalization is integrated through `$t('my_team.myTeam_...')` for display texts. The recurring identical content for `shift.vue` suggests frequent saves or automatic logging without actual code modifications in many instances, with the primary changes being introduced at the first timestamp and then a specific data property modification at a later point in a different, likely related, file.

## 15:21:00
The provided logs detail changes across three distinct code files within a "binhendi" project, focusing on letter generation and HR self-service request functionalities. All recorded changes occurred on **22/10/2025**, within a focused period, suggesting a dedicated development session or series of minor updates.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-admin/components/configurations/LetterTemplate.vue`** (multiple entries between 12:49:58 and 13:08:23):
    *   This Vue component is designed for managing letter templates, presenting a user interface with "CREATE NEW LETTER", "CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER", and "Letter Key Hints" tabs.
    *   **"CREATE NEW LETTER" functionality** allows defining new letter types, subtypes (specifically for 'NOC'), categories (multi-select), and date formats. It includes features to limit the number of requests by specifying a `limit_period` and `request_limit`, supported by interactive chips. A "Preview" option is available to visualize the new letter.
    *   **"CHOOSE EXISTING LETTER" functionality** provides an interface to select and modify existing letter requests, including updating categories, date formats, and request limits. It offers actions such as deleting a letter template (with a confirmation dialog), updating the request, and generating "PDF Preview" and "Before Approve Preview".
    *   The component heavily utilizes Vuetify UI elements for form inputs, navigation, and interactive elements. The content within the provided log entries for this file remains consistently identical, indicating that the recorded timestamps likely represent frequent saves or non-functional modifications.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/services/letter.service.js`** (22/10/2025, 13:24:28):
    *   This Node.js service is central to generating letter content and previews on the backend.
    *   It incorporates `moment-timezone` for date formatting and `axios` for network requests, including a `toBase64` utility function to convert image URLs for embedding.
    *   Key functions `combineHtmlPreview` and `combineHtmlPDF` are responsible for constructing the letter's HTML structure. They dynamically inject user data, company information, and letter-specific fields into templates, applying distinct styling configurations (`previewStyles` vs. `pdfStyles`).
    *   The `combineHtmlPDF` function specifically handles HTML entity decoding (`he.decode`) and applies inline CSS (e.g., specifying 'EB Garamond' font) for consistent PDF rendering, converting images like signatures and stamps to base64 for direct embedding.
    *   The service interacts with `User` and `Requests` database models and relies on helper functions from a dedicated `letter` module for data processing.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/helper/letter.js`** (multiple entries between 13:24:54 and 13:25:15):
    *   This helper module defines a `Letters` class that provides core logic for populating letter templates.
    *   It uses `moment` for date operations and `number-to-words` to convert numerical values (e.g., salaries) into their word representations.
    *   **`computeLetterAddressee` and `computeLetterContent` functions** are designed to replace placeholders (e.g., `[name]`, `[nationality]`, `[designation]`, `[companyName]`, `[totalFixed]`, `[salaryInWords]`) within letter templates using actual user and company data. These functions differentiate processing based on whether it's a new or existing letter request and handle specific logic for "Custom Letter Requests" and date formats.
    *   Auxiliary functions include `splitString` for newline-to-break tag conversion, `funGetCompanyDetails` for retrieving company information, `funGetUserTitle` for generating appropriate honorifics (Mr., Mrs., Ms.), `funGetUserName` for constructing full names, and `funGetUserInfo` for extracting various employee details (personal, employment, bank-related).
    *   The `funWithdrawLetter` function updates a letter request's status to 'withdrawn' and marks associated approvals as 'Withdrawn by Employee'.
    *   Similar to the Vue component, the provided log entries for this file are identical, suggesting minor saves or non-content-related updates.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent Timestamp:** All modifications across the log entries fall on October 22, 2025, suggesting a concentrated development or testing phase for these features.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Both frontend (Vue components) and backend (Node.js services/helpers) demonstrate a modular design, with specialized components/functions handling specific aspects like request creation, letter generation, and data processing.
*   **Emphasis on Letter Generation:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around the letter generation system, covering template configuration, dynamic content population, and robust preview/PDF generation capabilities. This includes extensive use of placeholder replacement in both front-end data structures and back-end processing.
*   **User Interface Consistency:** The frontend components consistently employ the Vuetify framework, ensuring a standardized look and feel for the administrative and self-service interfaces.
*   **Preview Features:** The system prioritizes preview functionality, allowing users to visualize generated letters in configuration and request submission, confirming the output before finalization.
*   **Minor Logged Changes:** For the Vue files and the `letter.js` helper, the identical code snippets across multiple timestamps imply that the log captured frequent save operations or very minor, non-functional changes such as whitespace adjustments, rather than substantive code modifications within the provided excerpts.
