# Activity Summary for 10/11/2025

## 09:27:24
The log details changes across two Vue.js components related to user profile management: `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/pages/user/profile/index.vue` for displaying the profile and `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/editProfile.vue` for editing it.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/pages/user/profile/index.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 10/11/2025, 08:38:09**: A minor textual correction was made in the "Emergency Contact" section, changing the title from "Emergency Contactsss" to "Emergency Contact".
    *   **Timestamp: 10/11/2025, 09:11:14**: The code responsible for displaying individual emergency contact details within the "Emergency Contact" section was commented out. This means that while the section title and edit button remain, the specific fields (like name, phone number, etc.) are no longer rendered in the read-only profile view.
    *   Other entries for this file show no functional changes, reiterating the existing content. The file primarily focuses on displaying various user details such as status, employee ID, avatar, full name, designation, contact information (email, phone, WhatsApp), personal contact details (phone, WhatsApp, email), reporting manager, a bio section, personal information, emergency contacts (now summarized), and a data table for sponsored dependents with actions to view documents and edit.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/editProfile.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 10/11/2025, 08:48:04** and **10/11/2025, 09:16:54**: This component provides a tabbed interface for editing different categories of user information including Personal, Emergency, Banking, Medical, Documents, and Insurance. The "Personal" tab allows users to update their profile picture, bio, first name, middle name, last name, personal mobile number, personal WhatsApp number, marital status, gender, nationality, personal email, date of birth, and address details (area name, zone number, street number). Visibility toggles (eye icons) are implemented for sensitive personal contact fields (phone, WhatsApp, email, DOB). A minor observation is the duplication of the "Middle Name" input field, bound to `new_details.middle_name` and `selectedUser.middle_name` respectively.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue.js and Vuetify Framework**: Both files are Vue.js components extensively using the Vuetify framework for UI elements (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-tabs`, `v-text-field`, `v-data-table`).
*   **Dynamic Content Rendering**: A strong pattern is the use of conditional rendering directives (`v-if`) coupled with custom helper functions (`isComponentVisible`, `isSectionCheck`, `isComponentEditable`) to control which parts of the profile are displayed or can be edited based on specific criteria, likely permissions or data availability.
*   **User Profile Focus**: The entirety of the log pertains to user profile management, encompassing both viewing and editing capabilities for personal, contact, and dependent information.
*   **Consistent Styling**: There's a recurring use of custom and utility CSS classes (e.g., `borderRadiusCards`, `eventCard`, `darkBlue-heading-text`, `textFontSize`) and inline styles, suggesting adherence to a design system across the application.
*   **Data Display and Input**: Data is displayed using Vue's interpolation (`{{ user.property }}`) and input is handled via `v-model`. Filters like `truncateText` and `formatDDMY` are applied for data presentation.
*   **Image Handling**: Both components interact with user profile images, with the display component showing the user's avatar and the edit component offering functionality to update or remove the profile picture.
*   **"Change Password" Link**: The profile display consistently includes a "Change Password" link, indicating a standard feature in user management.
