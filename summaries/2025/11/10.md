# Activity Summary for 10/11/2025

## 09:27:24
The log details changes across two Vue.js components related to user profile management: `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/pages/user/profile/index.vue` for displaying the profile and `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/editProfile.vue` for editing it.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/pages/user/profile/index.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 10/11/2025, 08:38:09**: A minor textual correction was made in the "Emergency Contact" section, changing the title from "Emergency Contactsss" to "Emergency Contact".
    *   **Timestamp: 10/11/2025, 09:11:14**: The code responsible for displaying individual emergency contact details within the "Emergency Contact" section was commented out. This means that while the section title and edit button remain, the specific fields (like name, phone number, etc.) are no longer rendered in the read-only profile view.
    *   Other entries for this file show no functional changes, reiterating the existing content. The file primarily focuses on displaying various user details such as status, employee ID, avatar, full name, designation, contact information (email, phone, WhatsApp), personal contact details (phone, WhatsApp, email), reporting manager, a bio section, personal information, emergency contacts (now summarized), and a data table for sponsored dependents with actions to view documents and edit.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/editProfile.vue`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 10/11/2025, 08:48:04** and **10/11/2025, 09:16:54**: This component provides a tabbed interface for editing different categories of user information including Personal, Emergency, Banking, Medical, Documents, and Insurance. The "Personal" tab allows users to update their profile picture, bio, first name, middle name, last name, personal mobile number, personal WhatsApp number, marital status, gender, nationality, personal email, date of birth, and address details (area name, zone number, street number). Visibility toggles (eye icons) are implemented for sensitive personal contact fields (phone, WhatsApp, email, DOB). A minor observation is the duplication of the "Middle Name" input field, bound to `new_details.middle_name` and `selectedUser.middle_name` respectively.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue.js and Vuetify Framework**: Both files are Vue.js components extensively using the Vuetify framework for UI elements (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-tabs`, `v-text-field`, `v-data-table`).
*   **Dynamic Content Rendering**: A strong pattern is the use of conditional rendering directives (`v-if`) coupled with custom helper functions (`isComponentVisible`, `isSectionCheck`, `isComponentEditable`) to control which parts of the profile are displayed or can be edited based on specific criteria, likely permissions or data availability.
*   **User Profile Focus**: The entirety of the log pertains to user profile management, encompassing both viewing and editing capabilities for personal, contact, and dependent information.
*   **Consistent Styling**: There's a recurring use of custom and utility CSS classes (e.g., `borderRadiusCards`, `eventCard`, `darkBlue-heading-text`, `textFontSize`) and inline styles, suggesting adherence to a design system across the application.
*   **Data Display and Input**: Data is displayed using Vue's interpolation (`{{ user.property }}`) and input is handled via `v-model`. Filters like `truncateText` and `formatDDMY` are applied for data presentation.
*   **Image Handling**: Both components interact with user profile images, with the display component showing the user's avatar and the edit component offering functionality to update or remove the profile picture.
*   **"Change Password" Link**: The profile display consistently includes a "Change Password" link, indicating a standard feature in user management.

The changes primarily focus on two Vue.js components within an administrative panel for managing user profiles: `/pages/user/profile/index.vue` (user profile display) and `/components/reuseable/editProfile.vue` (user profile editing form).

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/pages/user/profile/index.vue`**
    *   **10/11/2025, 08:37:27**: Initial structure for displaying a user's profile. This includes general user details (status, employee ID, name, designation, avatar, reporting manager, change password link), various contact methods (email, phone, WhatsApp, personal phone, personal WhatsApp, personal email), and categorized sections for "Your Bio," "Personal Information," "Emergency Contactsss" (with a typo), and "Dependents." The "Dependents" section uses a `v-data-table` to display details like names, relationships, IDs, and expiry dates, with an edit action button.
    *   **10/11/2025, 08:38:09**: Corrected a typo in the "Emergency Contactsss" section title to "Emergency Contact."
    *   **10/11/2025, 09:09:40**: Reintroduced the typo, changing "Emergency Contact" back to "Emergency Contactssss."
    *   **10/11/2025, 09:10:02**: Corrected the typo again, changing "Emergency Contactssss" back to "Emergency Contact."
    *   **10/11/2025, 09:11:14**: Commented out the `v-row` block responsible for displaying individual emergency contact fields within the "Emergency Contact" section, suggesting a change in how emergency contact details are presented or managed.
    *   **10/11/2025, 09:12:12 & 09:12:42**: No functional code changes observed in the provided snippets. These likely represent save operations without further modifications or changes outside the scope of the log.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/editProfile.vue`**
    *   **10/11/2025, 08:48:04**: Introduced a reusable component for editing user profiles. It features tab-based navigation for different categories: "Personal," "Emergency," "Banking," "Medical," "Documents," and "Insurance." The "Dependents" tab is commented out. The "Personal" tab allows editing fields such as: Bio, First Name, Middle Name (appears twice), Last Name, Personal Mobile Number, Personal WhatsApp Number, Marital Status, Gender, Nationality, Personal Email, Date of Birth, and address details (Area Name, Zone Number, Street Number). It also includes functionality for managing the user's profile picture (upload, remove) and features eye icons to toggle the visibility of sensitive personal contact information. Input fields are conditionally enabled based on editability checks.
    *   **10/11/2025, 09:16:54**: No functional code changes observed in the provided snippet. This likely represents a save operation without further modifications or changes outside the scope of the log.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/11/2025, 08:37:27**: Initial implementation of the user profile display page.
*   **10/11/2025, 08:38:09 - 09:10:02**: A series of rapid changes in `/pages/user/profile/index.vue` focused on fixing, reintroducing, and then re-fixing a typo in the "Emergency Contact" section title.
*   **10/11/2025, 08:48:04**: Initial implementation of the reusable profile editing component.
*   **10/11/2025, 09:11:14**: Significant structural change in `/pages/user/profile/index.vue` by commenting out the direct display of individual emergency contact fields.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Vue.js and Vuetify Framework:** Both files extensively use Vue.js `<template>` syntax and Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-btn`, `v-text-field`, `v-data-table`, `v-tabs`) for building the user interface.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Editability:** A consistent pattern of using `v-if` with helper functions like `isComponentVisible`, `isSectionCheck`, and `isComponentEditable` indicates a robust system for controlling what information is displayed and editable based on user permissions or configuration.
*   **User Profile Management Focus:** All changes revolve around displaying and editing various aspects of a user's profile, including personal details, contact information, social details (bio), and dependents.
*   **Image and Icon Usage:** Frequent use of `v-img` to display avatars and decorative icons (mail, call, whatsapp, edit, add_plus), often referencing SVG assets from `/profile/` and `/directory/` paths. Material Design Icons (`mdi-camera`, `mdi-close`, `mdi-eye-outline`, `mdi-eye-off`) are also used.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Recurring class names like `borderRadiusCards`, `eventCard`, `darkBlue-heading-text`, `grey-heading-text`, `rounded-xl`, `border-radius-medium` suggest a shared design system or theme.
*   **Typo Correction Cycles:** The repeated correction and reintroduction of a typo in the "Emergency Contact" section title (`Emergency Contactsss`/`Emergency Contactssss` vs. `Emergency Contact`) indicates a possible back-and-forth during development or commit management issues.
*   **Visibility Toggles:** The `editProfile.vue` component features a recurring pattern of `mdi-eye-outline`/`mdi-eye-off` icons next to personal contact fields, indicating a feature for users to control the visibility of their personal information.
*   **Data Display and Input:** Data is typically displayed within `<p>` tags with descriptive `<h5>` headings. Input fields are `v-text-field`, `v-textarea`, or `v-autocomplete` components.
