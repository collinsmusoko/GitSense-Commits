**File: `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`**

This file represents a comprehensive shift management interface within a "Team Central" module. The initial state recorded at **06/11/2025, 09:21:31** includes:
*   A **Bulk Upload Shift Schedule** dialog, allowing users to upload shift schedules via an Excel file, download a template, and view upload status/errors.
*   A main **shift calendar view** for displaying and navigating shifts by month.
*   Filtering options for shifts based on **work location** and **department**.
*   Action buttons for common shift management tasks such as **shift locking**, viewing **shift logs**, **bulk uploading for specific users**, and general **bulk upload**.
*   A **Shift Roster** dialog that provides detailed information about defined shifts, including names, abbreviations, colors, and specific start/end times (handling split shifts and 'off' shifts).
*   Dialogs for viewing individual **event details** (showing team members assigned to a shift) and a **"More Events"** dialog for days with multiple shifts.

Subsequent entries for this file at **06/11/2025, 09:24:36, 09:41:12, 09:41:29, 09:41:48, 09:41:58, 09:42:22, and 09:42:39** show identical code content. This indicates that while the file was saved multiple times, no functional or structural changes were introduced after the initial log entry provided.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/shifts/manualShiftAdd.vue`**

This component focuses on manually adding or generating shifts. The development for this file occurred in a rapid sequence of changes:

*   **06/11/2025, 09:32:34:** The component started with a form to define shift parameters, including work location, department, start date, and schedule duration (in weeks). It had a placeholder "Applicable On" section for days of the week, but the corresponding data properties in the script were not yet defined. It also included logic for filtering employees and emitting a `manualShiftGenerate` event.
*   **06/11/2025, 09:32:44:** **Introduction of Day Selection:** The `data()` object was updated to include `selectedDays: []` and `daysOfWeek` (an array defining 'All Days' and individual days from Monday to Sunday). This change made the "Applicable On" section functional for users to select specific days for the shift.
*   **06/11/2025, 09:32:57:** **"All Days" Checkbox Logic:** A `watch` handler was added for the `selectedDays` property. This new logic ensures intelligent behavior for the "All Days" checkbox:
    *   Selecting "All Days" automatically selects all individual days.
    *   If individual days are selected such that all days are covered, "All Days" is automatically marked.
    *   If "All Days" is selected, but then a specific day is deselected, "All Days" is automatically unselected.
*   **06/11/2025, 09:33:09:** **Shift Generation Logic Update:** The `emitManualGenerateShift()` method was enhanced to validate that at least one day is selected before generating a shift. It also refined how `applicable_days` are processed and passed in the `manualShiftGenerate` event payload, ensuring that 'all' is correctly translated into individual days if chosen.
*   **06/11/2025, 09:33:18:** **Styling Refinement:** A `<style scoped>` block was added to specifically target and adjust the `margin-top` and `padding-top` of `.v-input--checkbox` and `.v-input--selection-controls` elements, setting them to `0 !important` to fine-tune the layout of checkboxes within the component.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vue.js and Vuetify:** Both files are Vue.js single-file components heavily utilizing the Vuetify framework for UI elements (e.g., `v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-select`, `v-btn`, `v-calendar`).
*   **Internationalization:** The `$t()` function is consistently used for text content, indicating support for multiple languages across the application (e.g., `my_team.myTeam_location`, `my_team.myTeam_generate`).
*   **Shift Management Focus:** The changes clearly revolve around enhancing shift management capabilities, including bulk operations, manual creation, filtering, and detailed viewing of shifts.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** All changes occurred on the same day (06/11/2025) within a short time span, suggesting active and focused development on these related features.
*   **User Interface and Experience:** The updates demonstrate a focus on improving the user experience for shift creation, including clearer selection mechanisms (applicable days) and visual feedback (snackbars).
*   **Modular Component Design:** The use of distinct `.vue` files for `shift` (calendar view) and `manualShiftAdd` (form for adding shifts) suggests a modular approach to feature development.

The log details a series of changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/attendance/attendanceCalendarView.vue`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **06/11/2025, 14:28:34**: An important change occurred where a previously commented-out `<FullCalendar>` component block within the template was uncommented and made active. This indicates the integration of a calendar view for attendance.
*   **06/11/2025, 14:35:00**: The `eventContent` slot within the `<FullCalendar>` component was modified. A `v-if` condition was added to the `<p>` tag, ensuring that content is only rendered if `arg.event.extendedProps.eventContent`, `title`, and `count` are all defined.
*   **06/11/2025, 14:35:48**: Further refinements were made to the `FullCalendar` `eventContent` slot:
    *   The `v-if` condition on the `<p>` tag was slightly relaxed, removing the check for `count !== undefined`.
    *   The `@click` handler for events became conditional: `getEmployeesData` is now only triggered if `arg.event.extendedProps.eventContent.count` is greater than 0.
    *   Conditional styling was applied to the event `p` tag, adding `cursor: pointer` when `count > 0` and `opacity: 0.7` otherwise, visually indicating interactivity.
    *   The displayed text was made more robust with fallbacks: `title` defaults to 'N/A' and `count` to '0' if their values are missing.
*   **06/11/2025, 14:41:11**: All modifications made to the `FullCalendar` `eventContent` slot at timestamps 14:35:00 and 14:35:48 were reverted. The `v-if` condition, conditional `@click` logic, conditional styling, and fallback text for title/count were removed, restoring the slot to its state immediately after being uncommented at 14:28:34. The script imports, which appeared truncated in some intermediate logs, were also fully restored to include `moment`.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

The changes primarily revolve around the `<FullCalendar>` component and its `eventContent` slot. There's a pattern of attempting to enhance the display and interactivity of calendar events with conditional rendering, click behavior, and styling based on event data (`title` and `count`), followed by a complete reversion of these specific changes. Minor fluctuations in script imports (`moment` being present/missing) across various timestamps suggest potential auto-saves during development or incomplete logging of the script section.
