# Activity Summary for 14/11/2025

## 10:54:51
For the file `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/reuseable/claimRequest.vue`, updated on **14/11/2025, 10:38:22**, the changes primarily involve a Vue component designed for managing and submitting employee claim requests.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Claim Request Form:** The component implements a dynamic form for creating and submitting claims. It allows selecting an employee and then dynamically renders input fields based on the selected "Claim Type" and "Claim Sub Type."
*   **Dynamic Field Types:** The form supports various input types for claim details, including text fields, number fields (with optional calculation display), date pickers, select dropdowns, file attachments, and text areas.
*   **Form Actions:** Users can add multiple claim requests within a single submission, delete individual claim requests, save a request as a draft, or submit the final claim.
*   **Data Handling:**
    *   It fetches available claim sub-types from a backend API (`/claim/get_claim_types/`).
    *   It retrieves existing user claims (`/requests/users/claims/`).
    *   It supports file uploads for attachments (`/requests/upload-file`).
    *   Claim creation and draft saving are handled by `add_claim` API endpoint.
*   **User Interface and Experience:**
    *   Utilizes Vuetify components for a structured and interactive UI (e.g., `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-date-picker`, `v-file-input`).
    *   Displays a loader (`v-progress-circular`) during asynchronous operations and disables form fields when loading or in draft mode.
    *   Provides user feedback through a snackbar for success/error messages.
    *   Includes date formatting using `moment.js` and array sorting/ordering with `lodash`.
*   **Validation:** Basic form validation is implemented using Vuetify's `:rules` property, ensuring required fields are filled and file sizes are within limits (e.g., less than 2 MB for attachments).
*   **Props and Events:** The component accepts various props like `claimRequest`, `request`, `user`, `selectedEmp`, `companyData`, `userType`, `draftClaimReq`, and emits events like `addNewClaim` and listens for `user_changed`.
*   **Notifications:** Integrates a custom notification method to alert about new claim request submissions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Interaction:** Consistent use of `this.$axios.$get` and `this.$axios.$post` for backend communication, always including an Authorization Bearer token.
*   **Loader and Disabled States:** A recurring pattern of using `showLoader` and `isDraftRequest` to control UI elements' disabled states and display progress indicators, enhancing user experience during asynchronous operations.
*   **Dynamic UI Generation:** Extensive use of `v-for` and `v-if` directives to dynamically build form sections and input fields based on claim configurations and data.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Uses CSS classes like `grey-heading-text`, `font-weight-medium`, `textFontSize`, `redTextForm`, and `customMdiMenuDown` across various elements, suggesting a standardized design system.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** Relies on a global store (`this.$store.getters.getConf`) to fetch application configurations like claim types and sub-types.

The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/components/team-central/requests.vue`.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/components/team-central/requests.vue`**: This Vue component is responsible for handling various types of requests within a "team-central" admin interface.
    *   **Initial state (14/11/2025, 11:49:45)**: The component displays either a request creation form (if `createRequest` is true) or a list of existing requests. In the list view, a display string for pending requests had a typo: `All Pending Requestssss`.
    *   **First significant change (14/11/2025, 11:50:40)**: The typo in the pending requests display text was corrected from `All Pending Requestssss` to `All Pending Requests`.
    *   **Subsequent entries (14/11/2025, 11:58:43 to 12:57:24)**: The code content remains identical to the version at 11:50:40, indicating no further functional or structural changes were captured in these logs. These multiple entries likely represent minor saves, formatting changes, or re-indexing events without altering the functional code in the provided snippets.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The only discernible code change occurred between **14/11/2025, 11:49:45** and **14/11/2025, 11:50:40**, specifically a text correction. All other timestamps provided for this file show the exact same code as the corrected version.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Vue Component Structure:** The file uses a standard Vue component structure with `<template>`, indicating a user interface built with Vuetify components.
*   **Conditional Rendering for Request Types:** The component extensively uses `v-if` directives based on `requestType` to render different sub-components for various request types, such as 'leave', 'lieu' (time off in lieu), 'wfh' (work from home), 'remotely' (work remotely), 'allowance', 'advance' (salary advance), 'claim', 'attendance', 'letters', and 'salary adjustment'.
*   **Employee Selection:** Most request creation forms include a `v-autocomplete` component for selecting an employee, bound to `selectedEmployeeId` and triggering `fetchUserInfo()` on change.
*   **Consistent Styling:** Repeated use of Vuetify classes like `rounded-xl`, `pa-0`, `pr-5`, `pt-0`, `ml-0`, along with inline styles for `box-shadow`, `min-height`, `max-height`, and `max-width`, suggests a uniform UI design.
*   **Request List/History View:** When not creating a request, the component displays a list of requests. This view includes a search bar, a title that dynamically changes between 'All Requests' and 'All Pending Requests', and uses `RequestListing` sub-components to render individual items.
*   **Infinite Scrolling/Lazy Loading:** The presence of an `Observer` component and a `v-intersect` directive, along with a loading spinner (`v-progress-circular`), indicates functionality for infinite scrolling or lazy loading of request data.
*   **Props Passing:** Many sub-components receive various props like `selectedEmp`, `userType`, `user`, `configuration`, `users`, `companyData`, and request-specific data, suggesting a robust data flow and configuration system.
*   **Tooltips for Information:** A `v-tooltip` is used to provide detailed instructions for 'claim' requests.
*   **Action Buttons:** Icons for closing the request creation form (`/dashboard/close.svg`) and adding new requests (`/directory/add_plus.svg`) are consistently used.
*   **Manager/Admin Context:** The `userType` prop being explicitly set to `'MANAGER'` or `'ADMIN'` in multiple sub-components indicates different functionalities or views based on the user's role.
