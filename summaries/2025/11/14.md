For the file `/Users/collin/projects/babilou/babilou-admin/components/reuseable/claimRequest.vue`, updated on **14/11/2025, 10:38:22**, the changes primarily involve a Vue component designed for managing and submitting employee claim requests.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Claim Request Form:** The component implements a dynamic form for creating and submitting claims. It allows selecting an employee and then dynamically renders input fields based on the selected "Claim Type" and "Claim Sub Type."
*   **Dynamic Field Types:** The form supports various input types for claim details, including text fields, number fields (with optional calculation display), date pickers, select dropdowns, file attachments, and text areas.
*   **Form Actions:** Users can add multiple claim requests within a single submission, delete individual claim requests, save a request as a draft, or submit the final claim.
*   **Data Handling:**
    *   It fetches available claim sub-types from a backend API (`/claim/get_claim_types/`).
    *   It retrieves existing user claims (`/requests/users/claims/`).
    *   It supports file uploads for attachments (`/requests/upload-file`).
    *   Claim creation and draft saving are handled by `add_claim` API endpoint.
*   **User Interface and Experience:**
    *   Utilizes Vuetify components for a structured and interactive UI (e.g., `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-date-picker`, `v-file-input`).
    *   Displays a loader (`v-progress-circular`) during asynchronous operations and disables form fields when loading or in draft mode.
    *   Provides user feedback through a snackbar for success/error messages.
    *   Includes date formatting using `moment.js` and array sorting/ordering with `lodash`.
*   **Validation:** Basic form validation is implemented using Vuetify's `:rules` property, ensuring required fields are filled and file sizes are within limits (e.g., less than 2 MB for attachments).
*   **Props and Events:** The component accepts various props like `claimRequest`, `request`, `user`, `selectedEmp`, `companyData`, `userType`, `draftClaimReq`, and emits events like `addNewClaim` and listens for `user_changed`.
*   **Notifications:** Integrates a custom notification method to alert about new claim request submissions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Interaction:** Consistent use of `this.$axios.$get` and `this.$axios.$post` for backend communication, always including an Authorization Bearer token.
*   **Loader and Disabled States:** A recurring pattern of using `showLoader` and `isDraftRequest` to control UI elements' disabled states and display progress indicators, enhancing user experience during asynchronous operations.
*   **Dynamic UI Generation:** Extensive use of `v-for` and `v-if` directives to dynamically build form sections and input fields based on claim configurations and data.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Uses CSS classes like `grey-heading-text`, `font-weight-medium`, `textFontSize`, `redTextForm`, and `customMdiMenuDown` across various elements, suggesting a standardized design system.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** Relies on a global store (`this.$store.getters.getConf`) to fetch application configurations like claim types and sub-types.
