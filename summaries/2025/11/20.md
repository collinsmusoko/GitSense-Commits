# Activity Summary for 20/11/2025

## 09:49:49
The changes log details updates across two main file types: a Vue.js component and a JSON locale file, all occurring on November 20, 2025, within a roughly 27-minute window.

For the file `/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/components/reuseable/workSchedule.vue`:

*   **09:22:21**: The initial state shows a "New work schedulessssss" button text and an incomplete `computeNormalTo` computed property definition in the script section.
*   **09:25:45**: A minor textual correction was applied in the template, changing the button text from "New work schedulessssss" to "New work schedule". The `computeNormalTo` function remained incomplete.
*   **09:30:18**: A significant structural change occurred in the form's template where the `<v-col>` containing the "Schedule Types" `v-select` component was removed from its initial row alongside the ID and Name/Title fields. In the script, the `computeNormalTo` function was completed, and a new `computeHalfFrom` computed property was introduced but left incomplete.
*   **09:30:32**: The template change from the previous commit was reverted; the "Schedule Types" `v-select` component was re-added to its original position within the same row as the ID and Name/Title fields. The `computeHalfFrom` function in the script remained incomplete.
*   **09:38:23, 09:48:11, 09:48:29, 09:49:14**: No further changes are apparent in the provided snippets for this Vue component. The `computeHalfFrom` function remains incomplete across these timestamps.

For the file `/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/static/default-locales.json`:

*   **09:38:46**: This timestamp logs a comprehensive English locale file. It contains numerous key-value pairs, primarily consisting of detailed descriptions for HRMS features (e.g., functionality, efficiency improvements, module details, employee/manager capabilities, payroll processing, integration, security, and support), along with a wide range of common UI labels for an administrative interface.
*   **09:39:02, 09:39:14, 09:39:48, 09:42:53, 09:46:51**: No visible changes are present in the provided content for this file across these subsequent timestamps, indicating that the locale definitions were stable during this period.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All changes are tightly clustered on November 20, 2025, suggesting a focused development session.
*   The `workSchedule.vue` component shows iterative refinements in the UI text and form structure, with one instance of a change being immediately reverted, indicating active experimentation or correction.
*   There's a recurring pattern of incomplete `computed` property definitions (`computeNormalTo`, `computeHalfFrom`) in `workSchedule.vue`, suggesting ongoing work or debugging related to time calculations within the component's logic.
*   The `default-locales.json` file is a substantial collection of internationalization strings for an HRMS, hinting at a mature application with a focus on comprehensive user guidance and multi-language support. Its stability in the logs suggests it was committed as a large block of content rather than undergoing frequent line-by-line modifications during this time.
