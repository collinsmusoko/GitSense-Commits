# Activity Summary for 05/11/2025

## 08:53:58
The provided log primarily details changes to one functional Vue component and a single update to an environment configuration file.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue**
    *   **Timestamp of first significant change:** 05/11/2025, 08:25:46
    *   This Vue component manages an "Employment" section within an admin panel.
    *   It features a conditional display:
        *   An "Add New User" interface (`AddNew` component) is shown when `addUserFlag` is true. This section includes a card title with an "Add New User" heading and a close button.
        *   When `addUserFlag` is false, it presents the main employee management view.
    *   The main view includes:
        *   A search bar (`v-text-field`) for filtering employees by name or tags.
        *   Employee statistics, specifically displaying male and female employee counts and their respective percentages. These counts appear to be dynamic, switching between `computedMaleEmployees.length` / `computedFemaleEmployees.length` and `maleCount.myCount` / `femaleCount.myCount` based on a `userfetch` flag.
        *   A set of action buttons and icons:
            *   "Check Fields" (mdi-account-search icon) for global checks.
            *   "Expiry Documents" (custom SVG icon) to open an expiry view, visible only if `isManager` is false.
            *   "Bulk Salary Adjustment" (upload.svg icon) to toggle a modal.
            *   "Download Database" (custom SVG 'direct-inbox' icon) which is conditional on `totalCount == totalLoadedUserCount`.
            *   "Add User" (add\_plus.svg icon) to trigger the `addUserFlag` and show the "Add New User" form.
        *   An advanced search filter section (`mdi-account-filter-outline` icon) that can be expanded/collapsed. When filters are active (`hasFilteredSearch > 0`), it displays them as `v-chip` components, including filters for ID, Status, Employee Name, Email, Designation, Department, Cost Center, Job Group, Team, Date of Joining (`fs_doj_filter`), and Last Working Day (`fs_lwd_filter`). These chips can be closed to remove individual filters.
    *   There is also a significant commented-out block of code that appears to be for displaying employee cards based on status (All, Active, Inactive), suggesting a previous or alternative UI design that has been disabled.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Repeated file content without functional change:** The `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` file was logged eight times between 08:25:46 and 08:50:59 with identical content. This suggests multiple saves or version control commits without any alterations to the code itself during that period.
*   **Vue.js (Vuetify) component structure:** The `.vue` file clearly utilizes Vue.js syntax with a `<template>` section, making extensive use of Vuetify components like `v-card`, `v-card-title`, `v-img`, `v-spacer`, `v-btn`, `v-divider`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-tooltip`, `v-icon`, and `v-chip`.
*   **Conditional rendering:** The `v-if` directive is heavily used to toggle visibility of sections (e.g., `addUserFlag`, `emp_cards`, `!teamCentral`, `isManager == 'false'`, `totalCount == totalLoadedUserCount`, `hasFilteredSearch > 0`).
*   **Styling via inline styles and classes:** Many elements include inline `style` attributes and Vuetify-specific classes (e.g., `rounded-xl`, `allRequests`, `darkBlue-heading-text`, `subHeadingFontSize`, `borderRadiusTabs`).
