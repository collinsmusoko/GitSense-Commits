## 10:02:44
The log details a significant update to the `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/pages/onboarding/new-employee.vue` file on `21/11/2025, 09:25:46`.

This file represents a Vue.js component for a "Create New Employee" onboarding form. The changes primarily involve enhancing the form's structure, functionality, and user experience.

Key updates and features introduced or modified in this component include:

*   **Comprehensive Form Fields**: The form now includes extensive input fields for various employee details, categorized into sections such as Company, Personal, and Employee Details. These utilize Vuetify components like `v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, and `v-date-picker`.
*   **Dynamic Data and Autocompletion**: Many fields, such as "Company," "Select Flow," "Visa Sponsor," "Employment Type," "Select Location," "Work Location," "Nationality," "Role," "Contract Type," "Department," "Team," "Designation," and "Manager," are powered by dynamic data, likely fetched from configuration or APIs, and use `v-autocomplete` for enhanced selection.
*   **Input Validation**: Various validation rules (`genericRule`, `emailRules`, `phoneNumberRule`) are applied to ensure data integrity for essential fields like email, phone number, and required text inputs.
*   **Date Pickers**: Dedicated `v-date-picker` components are implemented for "Date of Birth," "Date of Joining," and "Expected Arrival," with features like minimum/maximum date constraints and internationalization support (`$i18n.locale`).
*   **Employee Profile Picture Upload**: A visual section allows for an employee profile image, featuring a `v-avatar` with a `v-hover` effect to reveal a camera icon (`mdi-camera`) for initiating an upload.
*   **Employee ID Handling**: A specialized input section for "Emp ID" includes an autocomplete for employee type (`selectedEmployeeType`) and a text field for the ID itself (`newId`), along with logic (`computedUserType`, `checkID`) that suggests dynamic generation or editing based on the selected type.
*   **Phone Number Input with Country Code Selector**: The phone number field is designed with a `v-autocomplete` for country codes, featuring country names, dial codes, and SVG flags, paired with a standard `v-text-field` for the number.
*   **Employee Details**: Fields for "Probation Period" and "Notice Period" are included as number inputs with dynamic suffixes ("Day" or "Days").
*   **UI/UX Enhancements**:
    *   Consistent use of `dense` and `outlined` styles for form fields.
    *   Layout is managed using Vuetify's responsive grid system (`v-row`, `v-col`) with specific spacing classes (`pl-0 pr-12`, `px-0 py-0`).
    *   Buttons for "Cancel" and "Create" include loading states (`:loading`).
    *   Headings (`span_leadHeading`, `subHeadingFontSize`) and structural elements (`v-card`, `v-divider`) contribute to a clear form layout.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   A strong reliance on Vuetify components (`v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, `v-date-picker`) for form building.
*   Frequent use of `v-model` for two-way data binding to an `onboardingUser` object.
*   Consistent application of `dense` and `outlined` props for styling inputs.
*   Repetitive use of `placeholder` and `label` for user guidance.
*   Standardized layout approach with `v-col` elements defining widths for `md` and `lg` breakpoints, often with `pl-0 pr-12` for horizontal spacing.
*   Date inputs consistently use a `v-menu` wrapping a `v-text-field` (as activator) and a `v-date-picker`.
