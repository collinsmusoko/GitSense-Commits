## 12:48:59
The `/Users/collin/projects/cybergate/cybergate-api/package.json` file, last modified on **18/11/2025, 12:27:27**, outlines the project's metadata, scripts, and dependencies.

**Key Information:**

*   **Project Details:** The project is named "hrdirect", version "1.0.0", described as a "REST API MODEL-CONTROLLER-SERVICES". It specifies `bin/createNodejsApp.js` as its binary and `src/index.js` as its main entry point. The author is "Voltaire Biton @ NATHAN DIGITAL", and the license is "NathanDigital". It targets Node.js version `v14.15.4` for engines and `14.18.0` via Volta.
*   **Scripts:** A comprehensive set of scripts is defined for various environments and tasks:
    *   **Application Management:** `start`, `staging`, `production` scripts use `pm2` for process management across different environments. A `shh` script is included to stop pm2 process 0.
    *   **Development:** `dev` and `devWsl` utilize `nodemon` for hot-reloading during development, with `devWsl` specifically allocating more memory (`NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096`).
    *   **Testing:** Scripts for `test`, `test:watch`, `coverage`, and `coverage:coveralls` leverage Jest, indicating a robust testing setup with coverage reporting.
    *   **Code Quality & Formatting:** `lint` and `lint:fix` use ESLint, while `prettier` and `prettier:fix` handle code formatting. `prepare` uses `husky install` for git hooks.
    *   **Docker:** `docker:prod`, `docker:dev`, and `docker:test` facilitate containerization for different environments using `docker-compose`.
*   **Dependencies:** The project has an extensive list of dependencies, highlighting several key areas:
    *   **Nathan Digital Ecosystem:** A significant number of packages prefixed with `@nathangroup/` are included, such as `apm`, `attendance`, `claim`, `leave`, `letter`, `payroll`, `ssomatrix`, and `wfh`, along with their corresponding `-email` versions. This indicates deep integration with internal Nathan Digital services and a focus on HR-related functionalities.
    *   **Cloud & Authentication:** Integrations with AWS (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `aws-sdk`), Azure (`@azure/msal-node`), Firebase (`firebase-admin`), and Google APIs (`google-auth-library`, `googleapis`) are present, suggesting a multi-cloud strategy and various authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Web & API Frameworks:** `express`, `cors`, `helmet`, `morgan`, `compression`, `express-rate-limit`, `socket.io`, `axios`, `request`, `node-fetch` form the backbone for API development and security.
    *   **Database:** `mongodb`, `mongoose`, and `ioredis` are used for data persistence and caching.
    *   **Document & PDF Processing:** A remarkably comprehensive set of dependencies related to PDF and document handling is present, including `@syncfusion/ej2-documenteditor`, `archiver`, `blob-stream`, `canvas`, `exceljs`, `pdf-creator-node`, `pdf-img-convert`, `pdf-lib`, `pdf-parse`, `pdf-poppler`, `pdf2image`, `pdfkit`, `pdfkit-table`, `pdfmake`, and `xlsx`. This suggests advanced capabilities for generating, manipulating, and extracting data from various document formats.
    *   **Email & Utilities:** `nodemailer`, `@sendgrid/mail` for email, `date-fns`, `moment`, `moment-timezone` for date handling, `dotenv` for environment variables, and various other utilities like `nanoid`, `node-cron`, `validator`, `winston`, `xss-clean` are included.
*   **Dev Dependencies:** These primarily support the testing, linting, and formatting workflows:
    *   **Testing:** `jest`, `nock`, `node-mocks-http`, `sinon`, `supertest` for comprehensive unit and integration testing.
    *   **Linting/Formatting:** `eslint` (with Airbnb, Prettier, Jest, Import, Security plugins) and `prettier` ensure code quality and consistency.
    *   **Other:** `nodemon` (also used in dev scripts), `husky`, `lint-staged`, `faker`, and `coveralls`.
*   **Overrides:** `puppeteer` is specifically overridden to version `^22.8.2`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Nathan Digital Ecosystem:** The most prominent pattern is the heavy reliance on `@nathangroup` internal packages, indicating a modular architecture built around a core set of HR-focused services.
*   **Robust DevOps & Quality:** The presence of `pm2` scripts, comprehensive testing (`jest`, `supertest`), linting (`eslint`), formatting (`prettier`), and Docker commands signifies a strong emphasis on continuous integration, deployment, and code quality.
*   **Advanced Document Processing:** The extensive list of PDF and document manipulation libraries points to a core business requirement for generating, parsing, and interacting with various document types, likely for HR-related reports, letters, and forms.
*   **Cloud Agnostic Approach:** The use of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud related dependencies suggests a flexible or multi-cloud strategy.
