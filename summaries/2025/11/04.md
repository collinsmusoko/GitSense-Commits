The changes log details updates across several core components of the `binhendi-api` project, all occurring on April 11, 2025, within a short span, indicating a focused development effort.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/routes/generic.route.js` (Timestamp: 04/11/2025, 10:58:12)**
    *   This file, responsible for defining API routes, has been significantly expanded to include a wide array of generic functionalities.
    *   New routes were added for comprehensive data operations like `/search` and `/filter` across various modules (Leads, Onboarding, Visa Process, Offboardings, Renewal Request).
    *   Extensive file and image handling routes were introduced: `/upload`, `/upload-img`, `/getbuffer`, `/upload-bulk`, and `/upload-base64`, indicating robust support for file management, including bulk and base64 encoded uploads.
    *   Process management routes were enhanced with `/process/proDetails/:module/:processId`, `/process/action/document`, and process flow management (`/process/flow`, `/process/flow/forward`, `/process/backward/flow`).
    *   Communication features were added for sending SMS (`/sms`) and various emails (`/send/mail/bulk-password`, `/send/emailraw`).
    *   A `/geocode/get` route suggests location-based services integration.
    *   A recurring pattern is the application of `verifyToken` middleware to nearly all new or existing routes, ensuring authenticated access.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/controllers/generic.controller.js` (Timestamp: 04/11/2025, 11:00:07)**
    *   This controller file implements the logic for the routes defined in `generic.route.js`.
    *   It imports `aws-sdk`, `fs`, and several utility and service modules, including `genericService`, `logger`, and `sendRawEmail`. AWS S3 related environment variables are referenced for file operations.
    *   Key updates include the implementation of controller functions for all the new generic routes: `searchLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest`, `proDetails`, `filterLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest`, various `fileUpload` methods, `getImageBuffer`, `processActionDocument`, `sendSMS`, `sendBulkPasswordEmail`, `getAllDetailsProcessFlow`, `genericSendRawEmail`, and `processFlowMoveForward`.
    *   A consistent pattern is the use of `catchAsync` to wrap asynchronous functions for error handling and the inclusion of detailed `logger.info` and `logger.error` statements, often recording the `userId`, `module`, and specific operation details, indicating a strong focus on logging and audit trails.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/services/generic.service.js` (Timestamp: 04/11/2025, 11:02:51)**
    *   This service file contains the core business logic for the generic operations.
    *   It imports a wide array of Mongoose models (e.g., `Leads`, `Onboarding`, `VisaProcess`, `Companies`, `Users`), along with `aws-sdk`, `sendsms`, `email` middlewares, `sharp` for image processing, and `axios` for HTTP requests.
    *   **`searchLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest`** and **`filterLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest`** are implemented using complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines, involving multiple `$lookup` operations to enrich data from `companies`, `users`, and `onboardings` collections. These functions support dynamic filtering and searching across various modules.
    *   The `getProDetails` function demonstrates dynamic model loading based on the `module` parameter.
    *   Filtering logic supports multiple criteria (status, date range, company ID, user ID) and handles both single values and arrays.
    *   The file shows integration with external services for SMS (`sendsms`) and email (`sendEmail`). AWS S3 environment variables (`BUCKET_NAME`, `SECRET_ID_AWS`, `SECRET_KEY_AWS`) are used for file interactions.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/services/document_template_clone.service.js` (Timestamp: 04/11/2025, 11:56:33)**
    *   This file manages document template cloning and generation processes.
    *   It imports several document-related models (`DocumentTemplatesClone`, `DocumentTemplate`, `Documents`), as well as `User`, `Companies`, `Configuration`, `lodash`, `axios`, `fs`, `AWS`, `moment`, and `WordProcessor`.
    *   Key functionalities include:
        *   `createDocumentTemplateClone`, `getDocumentTemplateCloneById`, `updateDocumentTemplateCloneOnId`, and `listAllDocumentTemplateClone` for standard CRUD operations on document clones.
        *   Functions like `getReplacedTemplatePast` and `getDocumentTemplate` (and `getDocumentTemplatePast`) are crucial for dynamic content replacement within document templates. They iterate through "auto-replace keys" and "user input keys," dynamically loading models and fetching data from various collections to substitute placeholders in the document content. This involves resolving foreign keys via the `Configuration` model.
        *   A significant update is **`PdfGenerateContentFile`**, which demonstrates integration with an external PDF generation service (`https://pdf-engine.devnhr.com/`). It sends the processed document content to this service, receives a PDF file, saves it locally, and then uploads it to AWS S3, updating the document's `fileUrl` status.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Modular Architecture:** The codebase consistently uses a modular structure, with separate files for routes, controllers, and services, and dynamic loading of Mongoose models based on `module` parameters.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** The `verifyToken` middleware is universally applied to new API routes, indicating a strong emphasis on securing endpoints.
*   **Extensive Logging and Error Handling:** `catchAsync` wrappers, `ApiError`, `httpStatus`, and detailed logger statements are prevalent across controller files, suggesting robust error management and a comprehensive audit trail system.
*   **AWS S3 Integration:** AWS S3 is a recurring component for file storage and management, referenced by environment variables and utilized in multiple service layers for uploads (generic files, images, generated PDFs) and buffer retrieval.
*   **Dynamic Data Retrieval and Manipulation:** MongoDB aggregation pipelines are heavily utilized in `generic.service.js` for complex search and filter operations across multiple linked collections. Dynamic content replacement in `document_template_clone.service.js` further highlights this pattern.
*   **External Service Integration:** The project integrates with external services for specialized tasks like SMS, email (raw and bulk), and a dedicated PDF generation engine.
*   **Date and Time Processing:** The use of `moment` for date calculations (e.g., `filterLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest`) is observed.
*   **All changes occurred on 04/11/2025**, indicating a concentrated release or development sprint.

## 13:32:41
The log captures a series of coordinated updates to a Node.js application's generic functionalities, primarily focusing on data search and filtering, file and image management, process flow, communication, and dynamic document generation. All changes were recorded on April 11, 2025, within a short period, indicating a single development push.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/routes/generic.route.js` (Timestamp: 04/11/2025, 10:58:12)**
    *   This file saw a significant expansion of generic API routes, all protected by the `verifyToken` middleware.
    *   New routes were added for:
        *   **Data Operations:** `/search`, `/filter` (for leads, onboardings, visa processes, offboardings, renewal requests).
        *   **File Management:** `/upload`, `/upload-img`, `/getbuffer`, `/upload-bulk`, `/upload-base64` (supporting various file and image upload methods, including base64, and retrieving image buffers).
        *   **Process/Workflow:** `/process/proDetails/:module/:processId`, `/process/action/document`, `/process/flow`, `/process/flow/forward`, `/process/backward/flow` (handling process details, document actions, and flow navigation).
        *   **Communication:** `/sms`, `/send/mail/bulk-password`, `/send/emailraw` (for sending SMS and different types of emails).
        *   **Geolocation:** `/geocode/get`.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/controllers/generic.controller.js` (Timestamp: 04/11/2025, 11:00:07)**
    *   This file was updated to include controller functions for all the newly defined generic routes.
    *   It imports necessary modules like `httpStatus`, `fs`, `AWS`, `catchAsync`, `ApiError`, `genericService`, `logger`, and `sendRawEmail`.
    *   Each controller function (`searchLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest`, `proDetails`, `filterLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest`, `fileUpload`, `getImageBuffer`, `fileUploadBulk`, `fileUploadBase64`, `processActionDocument`, `sendSMS`, `sendBulkPasswordEmail`, `getAllDetailsProcessFlow`, `genericSendRawEmail`, `fileUploadImage`, `processFlowMoveForward`) serves its respective route by calling a corresponding service function.
    *   A prominent pattern is the extensive implementation of logging for both successful operations and errors, capturing `req.userId`, `req.body.module`, and specific action details using `logger.info` and `logger.error` in conjunction with `loggerService.createLogger`.
    *   AWS S3 environment variables (`SECRET_ID_AWS`, `SECRET_KEY_AWS`, `BUCKET_NAME`) are used for file-related operations.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/services/generic.service.js` (Timestamp: 04/11/2025, 11:02:51)**
    *   This file contains the core business logic for the generic functionalities.
    *   It imports various Mongoose models (`Leads`, `Configuration`, `Companies`, `Onboarding`, `VisaProcess`, `Renewals`, `Offboardings`, `Processes`) to interact with the database.
    *   Functions like `searchLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest` and `filterLeadsOnboardingVisProcessOffboardingsRenewalRequest` implement complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines for dynamic data retrieval, including `$lookup` to join related collections (companies, users, onboardings) and `$project` for shaping output. These functions dynamically use `paginateLookup` on different models based on the specified `module`.
    *   `getProDetails` demonstrates dynamic model loading based on a `module` parameter to fetch process-related details.
    *   AWS S3-related environment variables (`BUCKET_NAME`, `SECRET_ID_AWS`, `SECRET_KEY_AWS`) are imported for potential file storage operations.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/src/services/document_template_clone.service.js` (Timestamp: 04/11/2025, 11:56:33)**
    *   This file introduces comprehensive functionality for managing and generating documents from templates.
    *   It defines CRUD operations for `DocumentTemplatesClone`.
    *   Key functions include:
        *   `getReplacedTemplatePast`, `getDocTemplateOnIDWithoutContentPast`, `getDocumentTemplatePast`, `getDocumentTemplate`: These functions handle the dynamic replacement of placeholders (`auto_replace_keys` and `user_input_keys`) in document content. They retrieve data from various modules and collections by dynamically loading models and using `Configuration` to resolve foreign key relationships.
        *   `PdfGenerateContentFile`: This function is responsible for generating a PDF document. It takes the auto-replaced content, sends it to an external PDF generation API (`process.env.documenturl`), saves the resulting PDF locally, uploads it to AWS S3, and updates the document's file URL in the database.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular and Generic Design:** A strong emphasis on generic routes, controllers, and services that handle a variety of "modules" (leads, onboardings, etc.) using dynamic logic. This is evident in the repeated use of `req.body.module` and dynamic model imports (`require(\`../models/${module}.model\`)`).
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Almost every controller function includes detailed logging statements to track user actions, modules involved, search/filter terms, and full error messages, indicating a robust monitoring strategy.
*   **AWS S3 Integration:** File and image management, as well as generated document storage, relies heavily on AWS S3, with environment variables configured for access.
*   **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines:** The service layer frequently employs complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines with `$lookup`, `$unwind`, `$project`, and `$match` stages for efficient data retrieval and transformation across multiple linked collections.
*   **Document Generation Workflow:** A dedicated service is built around cloning, populating, and generating documents from templates, including support for auto-filling data from the database and handling user input. This process integrates an external API for PDF conversion.
*   **Consistent Error Handling:** The `catchAsync` utility is consistently applied to controller functions, combined with `ApiError` for standardized error responses.
