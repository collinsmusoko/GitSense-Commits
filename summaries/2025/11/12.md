# Activity Summary for 12/11/2025

## 09:15:50
The changes log shows activity across two distinct files on December 11, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-admin/components/team-central/shift.vue`**: This file, responsible for a shift management component in the admin panel, was recorded fourteen times between 08:21:50 and 08:48:50. Despite the frequent timestamps, the provided code content for each entry is identical. This suggests the file was repeatedly saved without any functional changes being introduced or committed within this specific log period, or any changes made were immediately reverted. The component includes features for bulk uploading shift schedules, filtering by location and department, a calendar view for shifts, and dialogs for viewing event details and more events on a specific date. It also provides options for shift lock, shift logs, and viewing a shift roster.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/sata/sata-api/.env`**: This file was updated at 08:31:47. As this file contains sensitive environment variables and keys, a detailed summary of its content is omitted.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The most prominent pattern is the repeated logging of the *exact same content* for the `shift.vue` file over a span of about 27 minutes. This suggests a period of active work or debugging where the file was frequently saved, possibly without substantial, permanent changes being committed to the version control at each step, or perhaps local system saves were being logged.

The provided log entries are for a `.env` file, which typically contains sensitive environment variables and keys. As per the instructions, a summary will not be generated for files of this nature.

## 11:55:26
The provided log entries are for the file `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-api/.env`. As this is an `.env` file and likely contains sensitive configuration and key information, a summary of its contents and changes will not be generated in accordance with the instructions.
