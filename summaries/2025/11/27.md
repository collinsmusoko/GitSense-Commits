# Activity Summary for 27/11/2025

## 10:00:49
The log primarily details the state of a single file, `/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/api/client.ts`, at multiple timestamps.

**File-specific updates:**
The file `/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/api/client.ts` appears three times in the log, with identical content in each entry. This suggests no code changes were made to this file during the logged period, but rather its state was recorded consistently.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The file's content was logged on 27/11/2025 at 09:13:17, 09:13:34, and 09:13:48. While no code modifications are evident, these timestamps mark points where the file's consistent state was recorded.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
The recurring content for `/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/api/client.ts` establishes an Axios client for API communication. Key elements and patterns include:
*   **Base URL Configuration**: The API client's `baseURL` is dynamically set using `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`, falling back to `http://localhost:5001/api` if the environment variable is not defined.
*   **Request Interceptor**: A request interceptor automatically adds an `X-SSO-Token` header to outgoing requests. It retrieves this token from `localStorage` (`pms_sso_token`) but only if the header isn't already set, preventing overwrites.
*   **Response Interceptor**:
    *   On successful responses, it directly returns `response.data`.
    *   On error, it logs the API error and includes specific handling for `401 Unauthorized` responses.
    *   **Unauthorized Handling**: For 401 errors, it clears `pms_sso_token` and `pms_user` from `localStorage`.
    *   **Redirection Logic**: It attempts to redirect the user to a specified HRMS URL (`/dashboards/mywork`) using `import.meta.env.VITE_HRMS_URL` (defaulting to `http://localhost:5102`), unless the application is in development mode (`import.meta.env.MODE === 'development'`) or the current path is `/auth/sso`. In development, a warning is logged instead of a redirect.
*   **Environment Variables**: The use of `import.meta.env` for API URL, HRMS URL, and environment mode is a consistent pattern for configuration.
*   **Error Handling**: Centralized error logging and rejection of the error promise with `error.response?.data || error.message`.

## 10:19:12
The changes primarily involve two Vue components related to employee management and one sub-component for employee list display and another for user form stepper content.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**
    *   Between 09:51:27 and 09:52:38 on 27/11/2025, no discernible code changes were observed in the provided logs for this file.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue`**
    *   **27/11/2025, 09:53:20 to 09:57:22:** This file underwent a significant refactoring and enhancement over several consecutive updates.
        *   **Filter Logic:** The filter fields (`emp_id`, `user_status`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `designation`, `cost_center`, `date_of_joining`) in the advanced search section were updated. The `employee_filter` object was replaced with `filterSearch` (e.g., `employee_filter.emp_id` became `filterSearch.fs_empid`), indicating a potential rename or restructuring of the filter state.
        *   **Employee Statistics:** Male and female employee counts and percentages (`maleCount.myCount`, `femaleCount.myCount`, `percentagedata`) now conditionally use `computedMaleEmployees.length` and `computedFemaleEmployees.length` with `userfetch`, suggesting a dynamic data fetching or computed property approach for these statistics.
        *   **Search Input:** The `@input="onSearchInputHandler"` event listener was removed from the main search `v-text-field`, implying search logic might now rely on `v-model` reactivity or a debounced mechanism.
        *   **UI Buttons:** Buttons like "Check Fields", "Bulk Update Attendance Records", "Download", and "Add User" received updated styling props including `text`, `icon`, `small`, and `flat`, suggesting a standardization of button appearance.
        *   **Filter Form Layout:** The layout of the expandable filter form was adjusted, with changes to `v-col` `lg` and `sm` sizing for various input fields, possibly for improved responsiveness or organization.
        *   **Employee Listing:** The `v-for` loop for displaying employee cards transitioned from `users` to `visiblePages`, indicating the implementation of client-side pagination or infinite scrolling for performance or user experience.
        *   **Card Styling:** `gap: 20px` was added to the `directoryCard` class in the employee listing.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue`**
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:00:32:** Initial version showing employee cards with avatar, name, designation, and department, along with skeleton loaders for loading states. It includes an `onScroll` method for infinite scrolling (`loadMore` emit).
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:06:53:** The `avatar-wrapper` `div` that previously contained the `v-avatar` component was removed. The `v-avatar` is now a direct child.
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:07:16:** The scoped CSS styles related to `.avatar-wrapper` (including `z-index` and `transform` on hover for `employee-avatar`) were removed. The `overflow` property of `.employee-card` was changed from `visible` to `hidden`, preventing content from overflowing the card's boundaries. This suggests a simplification of avatar hover effects.
    *   No further significant changes between 10:07:16 and 10:17:07 in the provided log.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/user-form/UserFormStepper/StepperContent.vue`**
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:17:37:** Initial state.
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:17:46:** A `v-dialog` named `photoDialog` was introduced to enable a zoomed view of the employee's profile picture. The `v-avatar` component in the "Employee Details" section was updated to include an `@click="openPhotoZoom"` event listener, allowing users to open the dialog by clicking the avatar.
    *   No further significant changes between 10:17:46 and 10:18:27 in the provided log.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/11/2025, 09:53:20 - 09:57:22:** A concentrated period of updates to `employmentnew.vue`, indicating a substantial overhaul of employee filtering, display logic, and UI element styling.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:06:53 - 10:07:16:** Refinement of employee avatar presentation and card overflow behavior in `EmployeeList.vue`.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:17:46:** Introduction of a new photo zoom feature in `StepperContent.vue` to enhance image viewing for employee profiles.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Filter System Enhancements:** A consistent theme of modifying and improving employee filtering, evident in the refactoring of filter variables in `employmentnew.vue` and the dynamic calculation of employee statistics.
*   **UI/UX Modernization:** There's a clear move towards a more polished and responsive user interface, including standardized button styling, layout adjustments for forms, and new features like photo zooming and potential infinite scrolling/pagination.
*   **Internationalization Support:** Extensive use of `$t()` for all visible text elements (`{{ $t("...") }}`) demonstrates a commitment to supporting multiple languages.
*   **Component Reusability:** The architecture relies heavily on Vue components (`AddNew`, `FieldRenderer`, `EditBtn`, `UserFormCompensation`, etc.) to structure the application, suggesting a modular and maintainable codebase.
*   **Data Presentation:** Employee cards are consistently used for displaying user information in a grid format, including employee ID, status, name, designation, and department. Default avatar images are provided for cases where `image_url` is missing or fails to load.

## 11:19:04
The provided log details changes across two main Vue components: `employment.vue` and `employmentnew.vue` (both in `components/admin-central/`), and `EmployeeList.vue` and `StepperContent.vue` (under `components/admin-central/employment/`).

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`** (27/11/2025, 09:51:27 and 09:52:38):
    *   This component manages an employee list and an "add new user" form.
    *   The `v-else` block, which displays the employee list and filters, is extensively detailed in the provided logs.
    *   It includes search functionality, counts for male and female employees (with percentages), a filter summary display using `v-chip` components (for emp_id, user_status, first_name, last_name, email, designation, cost_center, date_of_joining), and an expandable "Advance Search" form.
    *   Actions like "Check Fields," "Bulk Update Attendance Records," "Expiry Documents," "Download Database," and "Add User" are available as buttons/icons, some conditionally (`!teamCentral`, `hideButton`).
    *   The employee list itself supports skeleton loaders for initial loading and displays employee cards with ID, status, avatar, name, designation, and department/team.
    *   The two entries for this file show identical content, suggesting the change was minimal, perhaps just a save action without functional alteration in the provided snippet.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue`** (27/11/2025, 09:53:20, 09:54:14, 09:55:16, 09:56:57, 09:57:22, 09:58:59):
    *   This file appears to be a newer or refactored version of `employment.vue`, indicated by the `new` suffix and several functional differences.
    *   **Significant Update**: The filtering logic has changed. Instead of `employee_filter.emp_id`, `employee_filter.first_name`, etc., it now uses `filterSearch.fs_empid`, `filterSearch.fs_name`, etc. This suggests a refactoring of the filter state management.
    *   **Employee Count Logic**: The display of male and female employee counts (and percentages) now dynamically switches between `userfetch` computed properties (`computedMaleEmployees.length`, `computedMaleEmployeesPercentage`) and `maleCount.myCount` / `maleCount.percentagedata.toFixed(2)`. This indicates enhanced logic for displaying employee statistics, possibly based on whether data has been actively fetched or is relying on a static count.
    *   **Download Button**: The logic for the download button explicitly includes `compny_name` in the filename for the XLSX sheet, which is a minor detail change compared to `company_name` in `employment.vue`.
    *   **Employee List Iteration**: The employee card display now iterates over `visiblePages` instead of `users`, suggesting a pagination or virtual scrolling implementation.
    *   **Filter Form Layout**: Some `v-col` `lg` properties within the advanced filter section (`v-card flat v-show="expandFilterForm"`) have been adjusted (e.g., `lg="3"` to `lg="4"`, `lg="4"` to `lg="5"`, `lg="6"`). This indicates a layout adjustment for the filter fields.
    *   Multiple entries for this file show identical content, implying repeated saves or minor non-functional changes during development between the timestamps.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue`** (27/11/2025, 10:00:32, 10:06:34, 10:06:46, 10:06:53, 10:07:06, 10:07:16, 10:10:02, 10:17:07):
    *   This component is responsible for rendering the list of employee cards.
    *   It uses `v-skeleton-loader` for a loading state, displaying skeleton cards.
    *   Each employee card shows `emp_id`, `user_status` (with dynamic color), avatar, full name, designation, and department/team.
    *   **Styling Changes**:
        *   At 10:06:53, the `avatar-wrapper` div was removed, and the `v-avatar` element moved up a level, effectively removing the hover-zoom effect for avatars (which had `z-index` and `transform: scale(3)`).
        *   At 10:07:16, the `avatar-wrapper` and its associated `:hover` styles (for `z-index` and `transform`) were completely removed from the `<style scoped>` block. The `overflow: visible` on `.employee-card` was changed to `overflow: hidden`.
    *   The component includes a scroll event listener (`onScroll`) to implement infinite scrolling or "load more" functionality, emitting a `loadMore` event when the user nears the bottom.
    *   Multiple entries for this file also show identical content, suggesting iterative saves around the time of the styling and structural adjustments.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/user-form/UserFormStepper/StepperContent.vue`** (27/11/2025, 10:17:37, 10:17:46, 10:18:06, 10:18:27, 10:26:06):
    *   This component renders a multi-step user form, including compensation, leaves, approval flow, pension, and logs sections.
    *   **New Feature**: A "Photo zoom dialog" (`v-dialog v-model="photoDialog"`) was introduced, allowing users to click on the employee avatar in the "Employee Details" section to view a larger version of the image. This functionality was added between 10:17:37 and 10:17:46, with the `@click="openPhotoZoom"` event handler.
    *   The component supports different modes (`view`, `edit`, `add`) and conditional rendering of various elements like "Send Credentials," "Reset Password" buttons, and comment/log sections.
    *   It handles form validation (`localFormValidMap`) and emits validation status for each step.
    *   Array-based sections (like beneficiaries or other configurable items) now explicitly use `$t(getSectionLabel(header))` for internationalized labels in the add/remove tooltips, ensuring consistency.
    *   Repeated entries for this file are present, indicating frequent saves during the implementation of the photo zoom feature and potentially other minor adjustments.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **27/11/2025, 09:53:20**: First appearance of `employmentnew.vue` with refactored filter state (e.g., `filterSearch.fs_empid` instead of `employee_filter.emp_id`) and dynamic male/female employee counts based on `userfetch`.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:06:53**: Styling change in `EmployeeList.vue` where the `avatar-wrapper` div was removed, impacting the avatar hover effect.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:07:16**: Further styling cleanup in `EmployeeList.vue`, removing associated `avatar-wrapper` styles and changing `overflow: visible` to `overflow: hidden` for employee cards.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:17:46**: Introduction of the photo zoom functionality for employee avatars in `StepperContent.vue`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Internationalization (`$t` and `$te`)**: A strong pattern of using `$t()` for translating UI text (e.g., labels, button texts, statuses) and `$te()` for checking if a translation key exists is prevalent across all `.vue` files. This suggests a robust i18n implementation.
*   **Vuetify Components**: All components extensively use Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-chip`, `v-btn`, `v-img`, `v-avatar`, `v-tooltip`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-dialog`, `v-stepper`).
*   **Employee Data Display**: Employee information (ID, status, name, designation, department, team) is consistently displayed across different views, often with conditional rendering or dynamic styling (e.g., status colors).
*   **Filtering and Search**: Both `employment.vue` and `employmentnew.vue` feature search inputs and advanced filter forms with chips to show active filters. The filter fields cover common employee attributes like ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, and date of joining.
*   **Loading States**: `v-progress-circular` and `v-skeleton-loader` are consistently used to provide visual feedback during data loading or when a component is being fetched, improving user experience.
*   **Component Structure**: The code follows a component-based architecture common in Vue.js, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., `EmployeeList` for displaying employees, `StepperContent` for form steps, `FieldRenderer` for individual form fields).
*   **Data Handling**: There's an emphasis on passing `formData`, `configData`, `companyData`, and `users` as props, indicating a centralized data management approach.
*   **Styling**: Consistent use of inline styles and scoped CSS classes (e.g., `rounded-xl`, `custom-search-field`, `borderRadiusCards`, `employee-card`) for a cohesive UI.
*   **Event Emission**: Components frequently emit events (e.g., `@addNewUser`, `@loadMore`, `@viewUser`, `@commentSection`, `@open-send-credentials-dialog`, `@open-reset-dialog`) to communicate between parent and child components.

## 12:00:59
The provided log entries detail changes within the `ccl_pms` frontend project, focusing on API client configuration and two specific Vue components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/api/client.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file is logged three times consecutively at `27/11/2025, 09:13:17`, `09:13:34`, and `09:13:48`, and then again later at `10:50:55`. All four entries show identical content, indicating no functional code changes were introduced or committed in these specific instances.
    *   **Content Summary:** This file configures an Axios instance for API communication. It sets a base URL, defaulting to `http://localhost:5001/api` if `VITE_API_URL` is not defined. A request interceptor automatically adds an `X-SSO-Token` from `localStorage` (`pms_sso_token`) to outgoing requests if it's not already set. A response interceptor is in place to catch `401 Unauthorized` errors. Upon a 401, it clears `pms_sso_token` and `pms_user` from `localStorage` and redirects the user to the HRMS dashboard (`VITE_HRMS_URL/dashboards/mywork`), unless the application is in development mode or the current path is `/auth/sso`.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/views/SSOHandler.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `27/11/2025, 10:09:09`.
    *   **Content Summary:** This Vue component is responsible for handling Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication initiated from an HRMS system. It displays a loading spinner during authentication or an error message if authentication fails.
        *   Upon mounting, it extracts an authentication token from the URL query parameters.
        *   It then sends this token to the backend (`/auth/validate-sso`) for validation.
        *   On successful validation, it stores the SSO token and user data in `localStorage`, updates the Vuex user store, cleans the URL (removes the token), and redirects the user to the application's dashboard (`/`). It also posts a `PMS_AUTH_SUCCESS` message to the parent window if running within an iframe.
        *   If authentication fails (e.g., due to an expired token), it displays an appropriate error message and, if running standalone, redirects back to the HRMS after a short delay. It also posts a `PMS_AUTH_FAILED` message to the parent window.
        *   It provides "Back to HRMS" and "Retry" buttons in case of failure.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/views/Tasks.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Initial commit at `27/11/2025, 11:10:15`. A subsequent update at `27/11/2025, 11:18:21` made a minor text correction.
    *   **Content Summary (Initial Commit):** This Vue component manages and displays a list of tasks. It includes:
        *   A task count display.
        *   Action buttons for "AI Insights" (admin only), "Import from File", and a "New Tasksssss" button.
        *   Multiple filters for tasks: search query, "Assigned to Me" toggle, project, status, priority, and assigned user (for admin/manager roles).
        *   Loading and empty states for the task list.
        *   A grid display for `TaskCard` components.
        *   A **Create Task Modal** with a comprehensive form for task details including title, description (using `RichTextEditor`), project assignment, status, priority, due date (cannot be in the past), assigned users (with search and profile picture/initials display), and file attachments (drag-and-drop, 50MB max per file).
        *   A `ContextMenu` for task actions (edit, delete) and a `ConfirmDialog` for task deletion.
        *   An **Upload Tasks Modal** designed for "Create Tasks from Notes" by uploading documents for AI to extract tasks, requiring a project selection.
    *   **Specific Update (11:18:21):** The text on the "New Tasksssss" button was corrected to "New Task". This was the only functional change observed between the two `Tasks.vue` logs.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment Variable Reliance:** The frontend consistently uses `import.meta.env` (e.g., `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_HRMS_URL`, `MODE`) for configuration, allowing for flexible deployment and local development setup.
*   **SSO Integration:** There's a strong pattern around Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication, involving token exchange via URL parameters, `localStorage` for session management (`pms_sso_token`, `pms_user`), and structured redirection logic to an external HRMS system upon unauthorized access or SSO validation.
*   **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Both the `client.ts` and `SSOHandler.vue` files demonstrate robust error handling, including console logging, specific messages for common issues (like "Token expired"), and user-friendly redirects or button options.
*   **`localStorage` Usage:** `localStorage` is extensively used for persisting user-specific data like the SSO token and user object across sessions.
*   **UI/UX Modals:** The `Tasks.vue` component highlights a pattern of using modals (`Teleport`, `Transition`) for creating new items and handling uploads, improving the user experience by keeping complex forms isolated.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in UI:** Elements like the "AI Insights" button and specific filters in `Tasks.vue` are conditionally rendered based on `userStore.isAdmin()` or `userStore.isManager()`, indicating a client-side implementation of role-based access.

## 12:19:00
The provided log shows a series of changes across two main files: `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue`, and a new component file `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/user-form/UserFormStepper/StepperContent.vue`. All changes occurred on **November 27, 2025**.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` (09:51:27 - 09:52:38)**:
    *   This file seems to represent an older version or a base for the employee management view.
    *   The primary filter chips (`v-chip`) bind their `v-show` and `@click:close` directives to `employee_filter.emp_id`, `employee_filter.user_status`, `employee_filter.first_name`, `employee_filter.last_name`, `employee_filter.email`, `employee_filter.designation`, `employee_filter.cost_center`, and `employee_filter.date_of_joining`.
    *   Similarly, the advanced filter input fields (`v-text-field`, `v-autocomplete`) are directly bound to properties like `employee_filter.emp_id`, `employee_filter.user_status`, `employee_filter.first_name`, `employee_filter.last_name`, `employee_filter.email`, `employee_filter.designation`, `employee_filter.department`, `employee_filter.cost_center`, `filterSearch.fs_doj_filter`, `employee_filter.doj_from`, and `employee_filter.doj_to`.
    *   The search input (`v-model="search"`) also uses `@input="onSearchInputHandler"`.
    *   Employee male/female counts display `maleCount.myCount` and `femaleCount.myCount` (and their percentages `maleCount.percentagedata.toFixed(2)` and `femaleCount.percentagedata.toFixed(2)`).

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue` (09:53:20 - 09:58:59)**:
    *   This file appears to be a newer iteration or refactor of `employment.vue`.
    *   **Major Refactoring in Filtering**: The filter chips and advanced search input fields (`v-chip`, `v-text-field`, `v-autocomplete`) have been updated to consistently use `filterSearch` properties (e.g., `filterSearch.fs_empid`, `filterSearch.fs_status`, `filterSearch.fs_name`, `filterSearch.fs_email`, `filterSearch.fs_designation`, `filterSearch.fs_department`, `filterSearch.fs_cost_center`, `filterSearch.fs_doj_filter`, `filterSearch.fs_doj_from`, `filterSearch.fs_doj_to`, `filterSearch.fs_lwd_filter`). This suggests a more centralized and possibly enhanced filtering mechanism.
    *   **Employee Count Logic Update**: The display logic for male and female employee counts has been enhanced to conditionally show `userfetch ? computedMaleEmployees.length : maleCount.myCount` and `userfetch ? computedFemaleEmployees.length : femaleCount.myCount` respectively. This implies that the application can now calculate these counts dynamically from a fetched user list (`computedMaleEmployees.length`) or fall back to a pre-calculated `maleCount.myCount`.
    *   **Search Input**: The search input (`v-model="search"`) no longer has an `@input="onSearchInputHandler"` directive, indicating a potential change in how the search is triggered or handled.
    *   **Pagination/Loading**: The employee list (`v-row v-for="(data, index) in visiblePages"`) now iterates over `visiblePages` instead of `users`, suggesting the implementation of pagination or infinite scrolling.
    *   **Styling Consistency**: Minor changes like `v-btn icon small` now includes `text` or `flat` attributes (e.g., `text icon small`, `icon flat small`), suggesting slight style adjustments to the buttons. The `download` button was updated from `icon` to `icon flat`.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue` (10:00:32 - 10:17:07)**:
    *   This file introduces a new component, `EmployeeList`, likely extracted from the main `employment.vue` or `employmentnew.vue` files to encapsulate the display of employee cards.
    *   It handles the rendering of employee cards, including skeleton loaders for loading states.
    *   It features infinite scrolling (`onScroll` method, `scrollContainer` ref, `loadMore` event emission).
    *   Each employee card displays `emp_id`, `user_status` (with dynamic color based on status), `first_name`, `last_name`, `designation`, `department`, and `team`.
    *   Employee avatars (`v-avatar`, `v-img`) include fallback images and grayscale styling for "Inactive" users.
    *   There's an overlay for `fetchingEmployee` to indicate when an individual employee's data is being loaded.
    *   **Styling Change (10:06:53)**: The `avatar-wrapper` div was removed, and the `v-avatar` element now directly contains the `v-img`. The related CSS rules for `.avatar-wrapper` were removed, and the `employee-avatar` class was removed from `v-avatar`.
    *   **CSS Update (10:07:16)**: The `overflow: visible;` property on `.employee-card` was changed to `overflow: hidden;` in the scoped style. This affects how content overflowing the card boundaries is handled, potentially to prevent children (like the scaled avatar on hover) from affecting layout outside the card. The avatar hover effects (`.avatar-wrapper:hover .employee-avatar`) are removed because `avatar-wrapper` was removed.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/user-form/UserFormStepper/StepperContent.vue` (10:17:37 - 10:26:06)**:
    *   This is a new, significant component responsible for rendering a multi-step user form (stepper).
    *   It includes a photo zoom dialog for employee avatars.
    *   Each step (`v-stepper-content`) iterates through headers and fields, rendering them using `FieldRenderer`.
    *   It supports array-based sections (e.g., `isArraySection`) with functionality to add/remove items dynamically.
    *   "Employee Details" header includes avatar display with an edit button and "SEND CREDENTIALS" / "RESET PASSWORD" buttons for view mode.
    *   Integration of `TabLogs` and `CommentSection` for auditing and feedback.
    *   Includes additional stepper content for Compensation, Leaves, Approval Flow, Employee Pension, and Logs, conditionally rendered based on `teamCentral` and `mode`.
    *   **Introduction of EmployeePension**: A new `EmployeePension` component is included for a specific step (`steppings.length + (teamCentral ? 3 : 4)`).
    *   **Timestamp 10:17:46**: The `v-avatar` for employee details now has `@click="openPhotoZoom"` and `style="cursor: pointer"`, indicating that the avatar image can now be clicked to open a photo zoom dialog.
    *   No significant code changes (other than the timestamp updates) between 10:17:46 and 10:26:06.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **27/11/2025, 09:53:20**: Introduction of `employmentnew.vue` with major refactoring of filtering logic and employee count display.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:00:32**: Creation of `EmployeeList.vue`, abstracting employee card display and introducing infinite scrolling.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:06:53**: UI/UX refinement in `EmployeeList.vue` by removing `avatar-wrapper` and adjusting avatar hover effects.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:07:16**: Styling change in `EmployeeList.vue` from `overflow: visible` to `overflow: hidden` for `employee-card`.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:17:37**: Creation of `StepperContent.vue`, introducing a multi-step form for user details, including a new `EmployeePension` component.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:17:46**: Enhancement in `StepperContent.vue` to allow clicking the employee avatar to open a photo zoom dialog.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Internationalization (`$t` directive)**: The `$t` directive is heavily used across all Vue components for text and label translation, indicating a multi-language application.
*   **Vuetify Components**: The application consistently uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-chip`, `v-img`, `v-avatar`, `v-tooltip`, `v-btn`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-dialog`, `v-stepper-items`, `v-stepper-content`, `v-form`, `v-overlay`, `v-progress-circular`).
*   **Employee Data Management**: There's a clear focus on managing employee information, including display, filtering, adding new users, and detailed user forms.
*   **Filter and Search Functionality**: Both `employment.vue` and `employmentnew.vue` feature search inputs and expandable advanced filter sections, suggesting a robust filtering system.
*   **Modularization**: The introduction of `EmployeeList.vue` and `StepperContent.vue` indicates a move towards more modular and reusable components, especially evident in `employmentnew.vue` which seems to delegate the employee listing to `EmployeeList.vue`.
*   **Dynamic Data and UI**: Conditional rendering (`v-if`, `v-show`) is widely used, along with dynamic data binding, computed properties (e.g., `computedMaleEmployees`, `computedMaleEmployeesPercentage`, `activeFilters`, `hasFilters`), and methods (`getStatusColor`, `onScroll`, `handleUserCardClick`, `commentSection`, `openPhotoZoom`) to create interactive and data-driven user interfaces.
*   **User Interaction**: Hover effects on employee cards and avatars, tooltips for actions, and click handlers (`@click`, `@input`) are common, indicating a focus on user experience.
*   **Image Handling**: Consistent use of default/fallback images for avatars (`@error` handler on `v-img`) and Amazon S3 URLs (`https://nathanhroperations.s3.amazonaws.com/profile_pics/Sahiba_T/avatar-7.png`).

The provided log details changes across several Vue components related to employee management in an HRMS admin panel.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 09:51:27**: This component displays employee information, including male/female employee counts, a search bar, and various filters (by ID, status, name, email, designation, cost center, date of joining). It includes actions like "Add New User," "Advance Search," "Check Fields," "Bulk Update Attendance," "Expiry Documents," and "Download Database." Skeleton loaders are used during initial data fetch.
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 09:52:38**: No discernible changes were made to the component's structure or functionality in this specific entry.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 09:53:20**: This appears to be a new or refactored version of the `employment.vue` component. Key changes include:
        *   **Filter State Management**: Filter values transitioned from `employee_filter.field_name` to `filterSearch.fs_field_name` (e.g., `employee_filter.emp_id` to `filterSearch.fs_empid`).
        *   **Combined Name Filter**: Separate "First Name" and "Last Name" filter fields (`employee_filter.first_name`, `employee_filter.last_name`) were consolidated into a single "Employee Name" filter (`filterSearch.fs_name`).
        *   **Dynamic Employee Counts**: Male/Female employee counts now conditionally display based on a `userfetch` flag, using `computedMaleEmployees.length` vs. `maleCount.myCount` and `computedMaleEmployeesPercentage` vs. `maleCount.percentagedata`.
        *   **Employee Display Logic**: The rendering of employee cards changed from looping over `users` to `visiblePages`, suggesting the implementation of client-side pagination or a more sophisticated display mechanism.
        *   **Minor Changes**: The `onSearchInputHandler` event was removed from the search input, and button styles were updated (e.g., "Check Fields" and "Add User" buttons changed from `icon small` to `text icon small` or `flat icon small`). A typo in the download filename (`compny_name` instead of `company_name`) was also observed.
    *   **Timestamps: 27/11/2025, 09:54:14, 09:55:16, 09:56:57, 09:57:22**: No discernible changes were made across these entries.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 10:00:32**: This is a new component responsible for rendering a list of employee cards with a scroll-based infinite loading mechanism. Each card displays employee ID, status (with color coding, and grayscale for 'Inactive'), avatar (with a fallback image), name, designation, department, and team. Hover effects for avatars are present, including scaling, shadow, and z-index changes.
    *   **Timestamps: 27/11/2025, 10:06:34, 10:06:46**: No discernible changes were made across these entries.
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 10:06:53**: The `avatar-wrapper` div was removed from the template, moving the `v-avatar` directly into the card structure. This change implicitly impacted the avatar hover effects defined in the component's styles.
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 10:07:06**: No discernible changes were made to the component's structure or functionality in this specific entry.
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 10:07:16**: The CSS rules for `.avatar-wrapper` and `.employee-avatar` hover effects (scaling, shadowing, z-index changes) were completely removed from the `<style scoped>` section, confirming the intention to simplify avatar rendering or remove those specific interactive effects.
    *   **Timestamps: 27/11/2025, 10:10:02, 10:17:07**: No discernible changes were made across these entries.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/user-form/UserFormStepper/StepperContent.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 10:17:37**: This component implements a multi-step user form, dynamically rendering various sections (Employee Details, Compensation, Leaves, Approval Flow, Employee Pension, Logs) using `FieldRenderer`. It supports different modes (`view`, `edit`, `add`), dynamic addition/removal of array items within sections, and integrates comment and log sections. A `photoDialog` exists for viewing the employee's photo, but the avatar in the "Employee Details" header doesn't yet have a direct click action to open it.
    *   **Timestamp: 27/11/2025, 10:17:46**: An `@click="openPhotoZoom"` event handler was added to the `v-avatar` in the "Employee Details" header, enabling users to click the avatar to open the photo zoom dialog.
    *   **Timestamps: 27/11/2025, 10:18:06, 10:18:27, 10:26:06**: No discernible changes were made across these entries.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Vue & Vuetify Stack**: All changes are within Vue.js components, heavily utilizing the Vuetify framework for UI elements.
*   **Internationalization**: Extensive use of `$t()` and `$te()` for text translation, indicating a multilingual application.
*   **Filtering and Data Display**: Components frequently implement search bars, advanced filters, and card-based displays for employee data, often with skeleton loaders for improved user experience during data fetching.
*   **Modular Component Design**: The introduction of `EmployeeList.vue` and the complex structure of `StepperContent.vue` (which imports many specialized sub-components) highlight a modular approach to building the application.
*   **State Management and UI Logic**: Changes often revolve around how data is filtered, displayed, and interacted with, including conditional rendering based on user roles (`!teamCentral`) or data availability (`userfetch`).
*   **Avatar Handling**: Consistent handling of employee avatars, including fallback images, grayscale filtering for inactive users, and new functionality for photo zooming.
