# Activity Summary for 27/11/2025

## 10:00:49
The log primarily details the state of a single file, `/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/api/client.ts`, at multiple timestamps.

**File-specific updates:**
The file `/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/api/client.ts` appears three times in the log, with identical content in each entry. This suggests no code changes were made to this file during the logged period, but rather its state was recorded consistently.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The file's content was logged on 27/11/2025 at 09:13:17, 09:13:34, and 09:13:48. While no code modifications are evident, these timestamps mark points where the file's consistent state was recorded.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
The recurring content for `/Users/collin/projects/ccl_pms/frontend/src/api/client.ts` establishes an Axios client for API communication. Key elements and patterns include:
*   **Base URL Configuration**: The API client's `baseURL` is dynamically set using `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`, falling back to `http://localhost:5001/api` if the environment variable is not defined.
*   **Request Interceptor**: A request interceptor automatically adds an `X-SSO-Token` header to outgoing requests. It retrieves this token from `localStorage` (`pms_sso_token`) but only if the header isn't already set, preventing overwrites.
*   **Response Interceptor**:
    *   On successful responses, it directly returns `response.data`.
    *   On error, it logs the API error and includes specific handling for `401 Unauthorized` responses.
    *   **Unauthorized Handling**: For 401 errors, it clears `pms_sso_token` and `pms_user` from `localStorage`.
    *   **Redirection Logic**: It attempts to redirect the user to a specified HRMS URL (`/dashboards/mywork`) using `import.meta.env.VITE_HRMS_URL` (defaulting to `http://localhost:5102`), unless the application is in development mode (`import.meta.env.MODE === 'development'`) or the current path is `/auth/sso`. In development, a warning is logged instead of a redirect.
*   **Environment Variables**: The use of `import.meta.env` for API URL, HRMS URL, and environment mode is a consistent pattern for configuration.
*   **Error Handling**: Centralized error logging and rejection of the error promise with `error.response?.data || error.message`.

## 10:19:12
The changes primarily involve two Vue components related to employee management and one sub-component for employee list display and another for user form stepper content.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**
    *   Between 09:51:27 and 09:52:38 on 27/11/2025, no discernible code changes were observed in the provided logs for this file.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue`**
    *   **27/11/2025, 09:53:20 to 09:57:22:** This file underwent a significant refactoring and enhancement over several consecutive updates.
        *   **Filter Logic:** The filter fields (`emp_id`, `user_status`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `designation`, `cost_center`, `date_of_joining`) in the advanced search section were updated. The `employee_filter` object was replaced with `filterSearch` (e.g., `employee_filter.emp_id` became `filterSearch.fs_empid`), indicating a potential rename or restructuring of the filter state.
        *   **Employee Statistics:** Male and female employee counts and percentages (`maleCount.myCount`, `femaleCount.myCount`, `percentagedata`) now conditionally use `computedMaleEmployees.length` and `computedFemaleEmployees.length` with `userfetch`, suggesting a dynamic data fetching or computed property approach for these statistics.
        *   **Search Input:** The `@input="onSearchInputHandler"` event listener was removed from the main search `v-text-field`, implying search logic might now rely on `v-model` reactivity or a debounced mechanism.
        *   **UI Buttons:** Buttons like "Check Fields", "Bulk Update Attendance Records", "Download", and "Add User" received updated styling props including `text`, `icon`, `small`, and `flat`, suggesting a standardization of button appearance.
        *   **Filter Form Layout:** The layout of the expandable filter form was adjusted, with changes to `v-col` `lg` and `sm` sizing for various input fields, possibly for improved responsiveness or organization.
        *   **Employee Listing:** The `v-for` loop for displaying employee cards transitioned from `users` to `visiblePages`, indicating the implementation of client-side pagination or infinite scrolling for performance or user experience.
        *   **Card Styling:** `gap: 20px` was added to the `directoryCard` class in the employee listing.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue`**
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:00:32:** Initial version showing employee cards with avatar, name, designation, and department, along with skeleton loaders for loading states. It includes an `onScroll` method for infinite scrolling (`loadMore` emit).
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:06:53:** The `avatar-wrapper` `div` that previously contained the `v-avatar` component was removed. The `v-avatar` is now a direct child.
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:07:16:** The scoped CSS styles related to `.avatar-wrapper` (including `z-index` and `transform` on hover for `employee-avatar`) were removed. The `overflow` property of `.employee-card` was changed from `visible` to `hidden`, preventing content from overflowing the card's boundaries. This suggests a simplification of avatar hover effects.
    *   No further significant changes between 10:07:16 and 10:17:07 in the provided log.

*   **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/user-form/UserFormStepper/StepperContent.vue`**
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:17:37:** Initial state.
    *   **27/11/2025, 10:17:46:** A `v-dialog` named `photoDialog` was introduced to enable a zoomed view of the employee's profile picture. The `v-avatar` component in the "Employee Details" section was updated to include an `@click="openPhotoZoom"` event listener, allowing users to open the dialog by clicking the avatar.
    *   No further significant changes between 10:17:46 and 10:18:27 in the provided log.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/11/2025, 09:53:20 - 09:57:22:** A concentrated period of updates to `employmentnew.vue`, indicating a substantial overhaul of employee filtering, display logic, and UI element styling.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:06:53 - 10:07:16:** Refinement of employee avatar presentation and card overflow behavior in `EmployeeList.vue`.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:17:46:** Introduction of a new photo zoom feature in `StepperContent.vue` to enhance image viewing for employee profiles.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Filter System Enhancements:** A consistent theme of modifying and improving employee filtering, evident in the refactoring of filter variables in `employmentnew.vue` and the dynamic calculation of employee statistics.
*   **UI/UX Modernization:** There's a clear move towards a more polished and responsive user interface, including standardized button styling, layout adjustments for forms, and new features like photo zooming and potential infinite scrolling/pagination.
*   **Internationalization Support:** Extensive use of `$t()` for all visible text elements (`{{ $t("...") }}`) demonstrates a commitment to supporting multiple languages.
*   **Component Reusability:** The architecture relies heavily on Vue components (`AddNew`, `FieldRenderer`, `EditBtn`, `UserFormCompensation`, etc.) to structure the application, suggesting a modular and maintainable codebase.
*   **Data Presentation:** Employee cards are consistently used for displaying user information in a grid format, including employee ID, status, name, designation, and department. Default avatar images are provided for cases where `image_url` is missing or fails to load.

## 11:19:04
The provided log details changes across two main Vue components: `employment.vue` and `employmentnew.vue` (both in `components/admin-central/`), and `EmployeeList.vue` and `StepperContent.vue` (under `components/admin-central/employment/`).

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`** (27/11/2025, 09:51:27 and 09:52:38):
    *   This component manages an employee list and an "add new user" form.
    *   The `v-else` block, which displays the employee list and filters, is extensively detailed in the provided logs.
    *   It includes search functionality, counts for male and female employees (with percentages), a filter summary display using `v-chip` components (for emp_id, user_status, first_name, last_name, email, designation, cost_center, date_of_joining), and an expandable "Advance Search" form.
    *   Actions like "Check Fields," "Bulk Update Attendance Records," "Expiry Documents," "Download Database," and "Add User" are available as buttons/icons, some conditionally (`!teamCentral`, `hideButton`).
    *   The employee list itself supports skeleton loaders for initial loading and displays employee cards with ID, status, avatar, name, designation, and department/team.
    *   The two entries for this file show identical content, suggesting the change was minimal, perhaps just a save action without functional alteration in the provided snippet.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue`** (27/11/2025, 09:53:20, 09:54:14, 09:55:16, 09:56:57, 09:57:22, 09:58:59):
    *   This file appears to be a newer or refactored version of `employment.vue`, indicated by the `new` suffix and several functional differences.
    *   **Significant Update**: The filtering logic has changed. Instead of `employee_filter.emp_id`, `employee_filter.first_name`, etc., it now uses `filterSearch.fs_empid`, `filterSearch.fs_name`, etc. This suggests a refactoring of the filter state management.
    *   **Employee Count Logic**: The display of male and female employee counts (and percentages) now dynamically switches between `userfetch` computed properties (`computedMaleEmployees.length`, `computedMaleEmployeesPercentage`) and `maleCount.myCount` / `maleCount.percentagedata.toFixed(2)`. This indicates enhanced logic for displaying employee statistics, possibly based on whether data has been actively fetched or is relying on a static count.
    *   **Download Button**: The logic for the download button explicitly includes `compny_name` in the filename for the XLSX sheet, which is a minor detail change compared to `company_name` in `employment.vue`.
    *   **Employee List Iteration**: The employee card display now iterates over `visiblePages` instead of `users`, suggesting a pagination or virtual scrolling implementation.
    *   **Filter Form Layout**: Some `v-col` `lg` properties within the advanced filter section (`v-card flat v-show="expandFilterForm"`) have been adjusted (e.g., `lg="3"` to `lg="4"`, `lg="4"` to `lg="5"`, `lg="6"`). This indicates a layout adjustment for the filter fields.
    *   Multiple entries for this file show identical content, implying repeated saves or minor non-functional changes during development between the timestamps.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue`** (27/11/2025, 10:00:32, 10:06:34, 10:06:46, 10:06:53, 10:07:06, 10:07:16, 10:10:02, 10:17:07):
    *   This component is responsible for rendering the list of employee cards.
    *   It uses `v-skeleton-loader` for a loading state, displaying skeleton cards.
    *   Each employee card shows `emp_id`, `user_status` (with dynamic color), avatar, full name, designation, and department/team.
    *   **Styling Changes**:
        *   At 10:06:53, the `avatar-wrapper` div was removed, and the `v-avatar` element moved up a level, effectively removing the hover-zoom effect for avatars (which had `z-index` and `transform: scale(3)`).
        *   At 10:07:16, the `avatar-wrapper` and its associated `:hover` styles (for `z-index` and `transform`) were completely removed from the `<style scoped>` block. The `overflow: visible` on `.employee-card` was changed to `overflow: hidden`.
    *   The component includes a scroll event listener (`onScroll`) to implement infinite scrolling or "load more" functionality, emitting a `loadMore` event when the user nears the bottom.
    *   Multiple entries for this file also show identical content, suggesting iterative saves around the time of the styling and structural adjustments.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/user-form/UserFormStepper/StepperContent.vue`** (27/11/2025, 10:17:37, 10:17:46, 10:18:06, 10:18:27, 10:26:06):
    *   This component renders a multi-step user form, including compensation, leaves, approval flow, pension, and logs sections.
    *   **New Feature**: A "Photo zoom dialog" (`v-dialog v-model="photoDialog"`) was introduced, allowing users to click on the employee avatar in the "Employee Details" section to view a larger version of the image. This functionality was added between 10:17:37 and 10:17:46, with the `@click="openPhotoZoom"` event handler.
    *   The component supports different modes (`view`, `edit`, `add`) and conditional rendering of various elements like "Send Credentials," "Reset Password" buttons, and comment/log sections.
    *   It handles form validation (`localFormValidMap`) and emits validation status for each step.
    *   Array-based sections (like beneficiaries or other configurable items) now explicitly use `$t(getSectionLabel(header))` for internationalized labels in the add/remove tooltips, ensuring consistency.
    *   Repeated entries for this file are present, indicating frequent saves during the implementation of the photo zoom feature and potentially other minor adjustments.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **27/11/2025, 09:53:20**: First appearance of `employmentnew.vue` with refactored filter state (e.g., `filterSearch.fs_empid` instead of `employee_filter.emp_id`) and dynamic male/female employee counts based on `userfetch`.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:06:53**: Styling change in `EmployeeList.vue` where the `avatar-wrapper` div was removed, impacting the avatar hover effect.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:07:16**: Further styling cleanup in `EmployeeList.vue`, removing associated `avatar-wrapper` styles and changing `overflow: visible` to `overflow: hidden` for employee cards.
*   **27/11/2025, 10:17:46**: Introduction of the photo zoom functionality for employee avatars in `StepperContent.vue`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Internationalization (`$t` and `$te`)**: A strong pattern of using `$t()` for translating UI text (e.g., labels, button texts, statuses) and `$te()` for checking if a translation key exists is prevalent across all `.vue` files. This suggests a robust i18n implementation.
*   **Vuetify Components**: All components extensively use Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-chip`, `v-btn`, `v-img`, `v-avatar`, `v-tooltip`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-dialog`, `v-stepper`).
*   **Employee Data Display**: Employee information (ID, status, name, designation, department, team) is consistently displayed across different views, often with conditional rendering or dynamic styling (e.g., status colors).
*   **Filtering and Search**: Both `employment.vue` and `employmentnew.vue` feature search inputs and advanced filter forms with chips to show active filters. The filter fields cover common employee attributes like ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, and date of joining.
*   **Loading States**: `v-progress-circular` and `v-skeleton-loader` are consistently used to provide visual feedback during data loading or when a component is being fetched, improving user experience.
*   **Component Structure**: The code follows a component-based architecture common in Vue.js, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., `EmployeeList` for displaying employees, `StepperContent` for form steps, `FieldRenderer` for individual form fields).
*   **Data Handling**: There's an emphasis on passing `formData`, `configData`, `companyData`, and `users` as props, indicating a centralized data management approach.
*   **Styling**: Consistent use of inline styles and scoped CSS classes (e.g., `rounded-xl`, `custom-search-field`, `borderRadiusCards`, `employee-card`) for a cohesive UI.
*   **Event Emission**: Components frequently emit events (e.g., `@addNewUser`, `@loadMore`, `@viewUser`, `@commentSection`, `@open-send-credentials-dialog`, `@open-reset-dialog`) to communicate between parent and child components.
