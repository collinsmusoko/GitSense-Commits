# Activity Summary for 26/11/2025

## 12:49:41
The provided log details changes to a single Vue.js component, `EmployeeList.vue`, on `26/11/2025, 12:43:51`.

### /Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue (Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 12:43:51)

This file represents a Vue component designed to display a list of employees with several key features:

*   **Loading State with Skeletons:** The component incorporates `v-skeleton-loader` to provide a visual loading indicator for employee cards, displaying placeholder content (avatar and text) while employee data is being fetched.
*   **Employee Card Display:** It renders individual `v-card` components for each employee, showing their `emp_id`, `user_status` (with color-coded chips using `getStatusColor` method), `first_name`, `last_name`, `designation`, `department`, and `team`.
*   **User Avatar Management:** Employee avatars are displayed using `v-img`. It includes a fallback default image if `image_url` is missing or fails to load, and applies a grayscale filter to avatars of 'Inactive' users.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Employee details like designation, department, and team are dynamically translated using `$t` and `$te` (translate existing) from `vue-i18n`, combined with a `formatToSnakeCase` helper for flexible key lookups.
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** The component implements an infinite scroll mechanism. The `onScroll` method, attached to the scroll container, detects when the user approaches the bottom and emits a `loadMore` event if more data is available and not currently loading, displaying a `v-progress-circular` at the bottom during subsequent loads.
*   **User Interaction:** Clicking an employee card triggers the `handleUserCardClick` method, which emits a `viewUser` event, passing the selected employee's data.
*   **Active Fetching Indicator:** An overlay with a `v-progress-circular` appears over an employee card if `fetchingEmployee` matches that card's ID, indicating an ongoing operation related to that specific employee.
*   **Styling and Hover Effects:** Employee cards (`employee-card`) feature rounded borders, smooth transitions, and a distinct hover effect that includes multiple box-shadows for depth and a slight `scale(1.025)` transformation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Vuetify Framework:** Extensive use of Vuetify components for UI elements (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-chip`, `v-avatar`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-overlay`).
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Frequent use of `v-if` and `v-else` to manage different states (loading, data loaded, scrolling loading).
*   **Dynamic Data Display:** Data is iterated using `v-for`, and content is dynamically bound to display employee information.
*   **Internationalization:** Consistent application of `$t` and `$te` along with a `formatToSnakeCase` utility to support multi-language content.
*   **Event Emission:** Use of `$emit` for communicating user actions (`loadMore`, `viewUser`) back to parent components.

Key Information for File: `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue`

The changes to `EmployeeList.vue` primarily focused on refining the interactive behavior of employee avatars and their associated styling.

*   **Initial State (26/11/2025, 15:29:02)**: The component displayed employee cards with basic details and skeleton loaders for a loading state. A `v-dialog` for photo zooming was present in the template but lacked corresponding `data` properties or methods in the script to function.
*   **Photo Zoom Implementation (26/11/2025, 15:29:21 - 15:34:03)**:
    *   The `v-avatar` element initially received a `click.stop` event to `openPhotoZoom`, along with a `cursor: zoom-in` style.
    *   `photoDialog` and `selectedEmployee` properties were added to the component's `data()` to manage the dialog state and selected employee data.
    *   The `openPhotoZoom` method was implemented to set the selected employee and open the dialog.
    *   The interaction was then shifted from `click` to `mouseenter` on the avatar and a new `mouseleave` event was added, indicating a change to hover-activated photo zoom. The cursor style also changed to `default`.
    *   The `v-dialog` itself underwent several cosmetic and functional changes: `max-width` was reduced to `500px`, `content-class="photo-zoom-dialog"` and `:retain-focus="false"` attributes were added, `v-card` received `elevation="8"`, and the close button was removed, relying on `click:outside` for closing.
    *   The `closePhotoZoom` method was added to properly close the dialog and clear the selected employee on `mouseleave`.
    *   Specific CSS rules (`.photo-zoom-dialog`, `.photo-zoom-dialog .v-card`) were introduced to manage pointer events for the hover-activated dialog.
*   **Removal of Photo Zoom Dialog (26/11/2025, 15:38:40 - 15:39:16)**:
    *   The entire `v-dialog` component was removed from the template.
    *   Initially, the `data` properties (`photoDialog`, `selectedEmployee`) and `methods` (`openPhotoZoom`, `closePhotoZoom`) related to the photo zoom dialog were retained in the script, though effectively unused.
    *   Subsequently, these unused `data` properties and methods were completely removed from the script section.
*   **New Avatar Hover Effect (26/11/2025, 15:38:50 - 15:43:09)**:
    *   An `avatar-wrapper` div was introduced around the `v-avatar` element in the template, without immediate styling or functionality.
    *   New CSS styles were later added for `.avatar-wrapper` and `.employee-avatar`. These styles implemented a direct visual hover effect on the avatar: on `hover` of the `avatar-wrapper`, the `employee-avatar` would `transform: scale(3)` and gain a `box-shadow`, accompanied by `z-index` and `transition` properties for smooth scaling and layering.
    *   To accommodate this scaling effect, the `.employee-card` style was modified from `overflow: hidden;` to `overflow: visible;` to prevent the enlarged avatar from being clipped.
    *   The `z-index` for `.avatar-wrapper:hover` was further increased to `9999` to ensure the scaled avatar always appears on top.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Employee Card Structure**: The core layout of employee cards, including `emp_id` and `user_status` chips, name, designation, department, and team details, remained consistent throughout the changes.
*   **Fallback Image**: The default image URL `https://nathanhroperations.s3.amazonaws.com/profile_pics/Sahiba_T/avatar-7.png` was consistently used as a fallback for employee avatars.
*   **Status Color Logic**: The `getStatusColor` method for dynamically coloring status chips (e.g., 'active' as green, 'inactive' as grey) remained unchanged.
*   **Scrolling & Loading**: The infinite scrolling functionality (`onScroll` method, `scrollLoading` prop, `hasMore` prop) and the initial loading state (`loading` prop, `v-skeleton-loader`) were stable components of the design.
*   **User Card Click**: The `handleUserCardClick` method, emitting a `viewUser` event, was consistently maintained.
*   **Avatar Interactivity Evolution**: There's a clear pattern of evolving the avatar's hover/click behavior, moving from a modal photo zoom (first click-based, then hover-based) to a direct CSS-driven scaling animation, suggesting an iterative design process for user interaction.

The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue`.

**File-Specific Updates (`EmployeeList.vue`):**

The changes primarily revolve around implementing and then refactoring an image preview/zoom functionality for employee avatars within an employee list component.

*   **Initial State (26/11/2025, 15:29:02 - 15:29:14):** The component included a `<v-dialog>` for a photo zoom feature, but it was not integrated with the employee avatars in the main list. The necessary data properties (`photoDialog`, `selectedEmployee`) and methods (`openPhotoZoom`) were undefined.
*   **Introducing Dialog-based Photo Zoom (26/11/2025, 15:29:21 - 15:29:35):**
    *   At **15:29:21**, an `@click.stop="openPhotoZoom(data)"` event and `cursor: zoom-in` style were added to the employee avatars, indicating an intent for click-to-zoom.
    *   By **15:29:28**, `photoDialog` and `selectedEmployee` were added to the component's `data()` options, making the dialog reactive.
    *   By **15:29:35**, the `openPhotoZoom` method was properly defined to set the `selectedEmployee` and open the `photoDialog`.
*   **Transition to Hover-based Dialog Zoom (26/11/2025, 15:33:43 - 15:34:15):**
    *   At **15:33:43**, the avatar's click event was replaced with `@mouseenter="openPhotoZoom(data)"` and `@mouseleave="closePhotoZoom"`, switching the interaction to hover. The `cursor` was changed to `default`. The `closePhotoZoom` method was not yet defined.
    *   By **15:33:55**, the `<v-dialog>` received styling and functional updates: `max-width` was adjusted, `content-class` and `:retain-focus` were added, the internal close button was removed (relying on `click:outside` for closing), and `elevation` was added to the `v-card`.
    *   At **15:34:03**, the `closePhotoZoom` method was added to reset `photoDialog` and `selectedEmployee`, completing the hover-to-zoom with a dialog.
    *   By **15:34:15**, CSS rules for `.photo-zoom-dialog` were added to manage pointer events, likely to prevent unintended interactions with elements behind the dialog during hover.
*   **Removal of Dialog and Introduction of CSS-only Hover Zoom (26/11/2025, 15:38:40 - 15:43:09):**
    *   At **15:38:40**, the entire `<v-dialog>` section was removed from the template, and the hover events were removed from the avatars. The associated `data` and `methods` were still present but unused.
    *   By **15:38:50**, the avatars were wrapped in an `avatar-wrapper` div, and `@mouseenter`/`@mouseleave` events were temporarily re-added to the avatar itself, though the dialog was still missing.
    *   At **15:39:05**, the `photoDialog`, `selectedEmployee` data properties, and `openPhotoZoom`, `closePhotoZoom` methods were completely removed from the script, signaling the abandonment of the dialog-based zoom approach.
    *   By **15:39:35**, a new CSS-only hover zoom effect was implemented:
        *   `avatar-wrapper` was styled for positioning and `z-index` transitions.
        *   `employee-avatar` (the `v-avatar`) was given `transform` and `box-shadow` transitions.
        *   On `avatar-wrapper:hover`, the `employee-avatar` would `transform: scale(3)` and gain a `box-shadow`, providing a direct image enlargement effect without a dialog. The `overflow` of `.employee-card` was set to `visible` to allow the enlarged avatar to extend beyond its card boundaries.
    *   At **15:43:09**, the `z-index` of `.avatar-wrapper:hover` was increased to `9999` to ensure the enlarged avatar always appears on top of other content.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **26/11/2025, 15:29:21**: Start of interactive photo zoom implementation (avatar click event added).
*   **26/11/2025, 15:29:35**: Full implementation of dialog-based click-to-zoom.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:33:43**: Transition from click-to-zoom to hover-to-zoom for the dialog.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:34:03**: Completion of dialog-based hover-to-zoom with `closePhotoZoom` method.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:38:40**: Removal of the dialog-based zoom from the template, indicating a shift in approach.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:39:05**: Complete removal of dialog-related logic from the script.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:39:35**: Introduction of CSS-only hover zoom effect.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:43:09**: Refinement of CSS-only zoom `z-index` for visibility.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** The log shows a clear pattern of iterative development, specifically around the image zoom feature. It began with a basic implementation, transitioned to a different interaction model (click to hover), and eventually changed the underlying technical approach (JS dialog to CSS transform).
*   **Frequent Saves/Minor Changes:** Several entries show no discernible code changes, suggesting frequent saves or very minor, whitespace-only modifications.
*   **Vuetify Components:** The component heavily relies on Vuetify components for its UI structure (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-avatar`, `v-img`, `v-chip`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-dialog`, `v-overlay`, `v-progress-circular`).
*   **Status Colors and i18n:** The `getStatusColor` method for employee status chips and the use of `$t` (i18n) for designation, department, and team names are consistent throughout all versions of the file.
*   **Fallback Image:** A specific Amazon S3 URL (`https://nathanhroperations.s3.amazonaws.com/profile_pics/Sahiba_T/avatar-7.png`) is consistently used as a fallback image for employee avatars if `data.image_url` is not available or errors.
*   **Skeleton Loaders:** The component includes skeleton loaders for `text` and `avatar` types, indicating a loading state UI for employee cards.
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** The `onScroll` method and associated props (`scrollLoading`, `hasMore`) indicate that the employee list supports infinite scrolling to load more employees.
*   **Employee Card Styling:** Consistent `employee-card` styling with a subtle hover effect (box-shadow and scale transform) is maintained throughout the changes.

## 18:03:55
The provided log details changes to the `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue` file, focusing on the implementation and subsequent refactoring of an employee avatar photo zoom feature.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **26/11/2025, 15:29:02**: The initial version of the component includes a skeleton for a photo zoom dialog (`<v-dialog>`) but lacks the logic to activate it. It displays a list of employees with their details, including employee ID, status (with color coding), name, designation, department, and team. It supports infinite scrolling and displays loading states.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:29:14**: No functional changes were observed; the code appears identical to the previous entry.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:29:21**: The `v-avatar` element for each employee was updated to include `@click.stop="openPhotoZoom(data)"` and `style="cursor: zoom-in"`, introducing a click-to-zoom functionality.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:29:28**: The component's script section was updated to include reactive `data()` properties: `photoDialog: false` and `selectedEmployee: null`, which are essential for controlling the photo zoom dialog's visibility and content.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:29:35**: A new method, `openPhotoZoom(employee)`, was added to the script. This method sets `selectedEmployee` to the clicked employee and `photoDialog` to `true`, effectively opening the dialog with the selected employee's image.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:33:43**: The photo zoom interaction was changed from a click event to a hover event. The `v-avatar` now uses `@mouseenter="openPhotoZoom(data)"` and `@mouseleave="closePhotoZoom"`, and the cursor style was reset to `default`.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:33:55**: The styling and configuration of the photo zoom dialog (`<v-dialog>`) were adjusted:
    *   `max-width` was reduced from `600px` to `500px`.
    *   `content-class="photo-zoom-dialog"` and `:retain-focus="false"` were added.
    *   The close button (`<v-btn icon @click="photoDialog = false">`) was removed from the dialog title.
    *   The title's span now uses `class="text-subtitle-1"`.
    *   The `v-img` inside the dialog had its `max-height` reduced from `500px` to `450px`.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:34:03**: The `closePhotoZoom()` method was added to the script, setting `photoDialog` to `false` and `selectedEmployee` to `null`, correctly closing the hover-triggered dialog.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:34:15**: New scoped CSS rules were added for `.photo-zoom-dialog` and `.photo-zoom-dialog .v-card` to explicitly manage `pointer-events`, ensuring proper interaction with the dialog itself while preventing interaction with underlying elements.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:38:40**: The entire `<v-dialog>` photo zoom component was removed from the template, although the `data()` properties (`photoDialog`, `selectedEmployee`) and methods (`openPhotoZoom`, `closePhotoZoom`) remained in the script.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:38:50**: The `v-avatar` element was wrapped in a new `div` with `class="avatar-wrapper"`. The `@mouseenter` and `@mouseleave` events, along with `style="cursor: default"`, were removed from the `v-avatar`.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:39:05**: No functional changes were observed; the code appears identical to the previous entry.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:39:16**: The `data()` properties (`photoDialog`, `selectedEmployee`) and the methods (`openPhotoZoom`, `closePhotoZoom`) related to the dialog-based photo zoom were removed from the script, completing the removal of the previous implementation.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:39:25**: No functional changes were observed; the code appears identical to the previous entry.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:39:35**: A new, CSS-only hover-to-zoom effect was implemented for the employee avatars. New scoped styles were added for `.avatar-wrapper` and `.avatar-wrapper:hover .employee-avatar` to scale the avatar, add a box-shadow on hover, and manage `z-index` for visibility. The `overflow` property of `.employee-card` was changed from `hidden` to `visible` to accommodate the enlarged avatar.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:39:53**: No functional changes were observed; the code appears identical to the previous entry.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:43:09**: The `z-index` of `.avatar-wrapper:hover` was increased from `10` to `9999` in the CSS to ensure the hover-zoomed avatar is prominently displayed above all other elements.
*   **26/11/2025, 15:45:39**: No functional changes were observed; the code appears identical to the previous entry.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Employee List Structure:** The component consistently uses `v-row` and `v-col` to display employee cards in a grid layout.
*   **Loading Skeletons:** `v-skeleton-loader` is used to display placeholder content when the employee list is loading, and `v-progress-circular` indicates ongoing loading during infinite scrolling.
*   **Employee Card Details:** Each employee card consistently displays `emp_id`, `user_status` (with dynamically assigned colors), `first_name`, `last_name`, `designation`, `department`, and `team`. Default avatar images are used for missing URLs.
*   **Internationalization:** The `$t` and `$te` functions, along with a `formatToSnakeCase` helper, are used extensively for localized display of designation, department, and team names.
*   **Status Color Logic:** The `getStatusColor` method provides consistent color mapping for different `user_status` values (`active`, `inactive`, `offboarding`, `rehiring`).
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** The `onScroll` method, bound to a `scrollContainer` ref, implements an infinite scroll mechanism to load more employees when the user approaches the bottom of the list.
*   **Card Click Handling:** `handleUserCardClick` consistently emits a `viewUser` event when an employee card is clicked, suggesting a navigation or detail view action.
*   **Employee Card Styling:** The `.employee-card` CSS class consistently applies styling for rounded corners, transitions, positioning, and a hover effect that enhances visual feedback.
*   **Refactoring Pattern:** The changes show a clear pattern of first implementing a feature (photo zoom dialog), then refining its activation method (click to hover), and finally migrating it to a pure CSS-based hover effect, removing the dialog component entirely.
