### /Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue (Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 12:43:51)

This file represents a Vue component designed to display a list of employees with several key features:

*   **Loading State with Skeletons:** The component incorporates `v-skeleton-loader` to provide a visual loading indicator for employee cards, displaying placeholder content (avatar and text) while employee data is being fetched.
*   **Employee Card Display:** It renders individual `v-card` components for each employee, showing their `emp_id`, `user_status` (with color-coded chips using `getStatusColor` method), `first_name`, `last_name`, `designation`, `department`, and `team`.
*   **User Avatar Management:** Employee avatars are displayed using `v-img`. It includes a fallback default image if `image_url` is missing or fails to load, and applies a grayscale filter to avatars of 'Inactive' users.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Employee details like designation, department, and team are dynamically translated using `$t` and `$te` (translate existing) from `vue-i18n`, combined with a `formatToSnakeCase` helper for flexible key lookups.
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** The component implements an infinite scroll mechanism. The `onScroll` method, attached to the scroll container, detects when the user approaches the bottom and emits a `loadMore` event if more data is available and not currently loading, displaying a `v-progress-circular` at the bottom during subsequent loads.
*   **User Interaction:** Clicking an employee card triggers the `handleUserCardClick` method, which emits a `viewUser` event, passing the selected employee's data.
*   **Active Fetching Indicator:** An overlay with a `v-progress-circular` appears over an employee card if `fetchingEmployee` matches that card's ID, indicating an ongoing operation related to that specific employee.
*   **Styling and Hover Effects:** Employee cards (`employee-card`) feature rounded borders, smooth transitions, and a distinct hover effect that includes multiple box-shadows for depth and a slight `scale(1.025)` transformation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Vuetify Framework:** Extensive use of Vuetify components for UI elements (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-chip`, `v-avatar`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-overlay`).
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Frequent use of `v-if` and `v-else` to manage different states (loading, data loaded, scrolling loading).
*   **Dynamic Data Display:** Data is iterated using `v-for`, and content is dynamically bound to display employee information.
*   **Internationalization:** Consistent application of `$t` and `$te` along with a `formatToSnakeCase` utility to support multi-language content.
*   **Event Emission:** Use of `$emit` for communicating user actions (`loadMore`, `viewUser`) back to parent components.

Key Information for File: `/Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue`

The changes to `EmployeeList.vue` primarily focused on refining the interactive behavior of employee avatars and their associated styling.

*   **Initial State (26/11/2025, 15:29:02)**: The component displayed employee cards with basic details and skeleton loaders for a loading state. A `v-dialog` for photo zooming was present in the template but lacked corresponding `data` properties or methods in the script to function.
*   **Photo Zoom Implementation (26/11/2025, 15:29:21 - 15:34:03)**:
    *   The `v-avatar` element initially received a `click.stop` event to `openPhotoZoom`, along with a `cursor: zoom-in` style.
    *   `photoDialog` and `selectedEmployee` properties were added to the component's `data()` to manage the dialog state and selected employee data.
    *   The `openPhotoZoom` method was implemented to set the selected employee and open the dialog.
    *   The interaction was then shifted from `click` to `mouseenter` on the avatar and a new `mouseleave` event was added, indicating a change to hover-activated photo zoom. The cursor style also changed to `default`.
    *   The `v-dialog` itself underwent several cosmetic and functional changes: `max-width` was reduced to `500px`, `content-class="photo-zoom-dialog"` and `:retain-focus="false"` attributes were added, `v-card` received `elevation="8"`, and the close button was removed, relying on `click:outside` for closing.
    *   The `closePhotoZoom` method was added to properly close the dialog and clear the selected employee on `mouseleave`.
    *   Specific CSS rules (`.photo-zoom-dialog`, `.photo-zoom-dialog .v-card`) were introduced to manage pointer events for the hover-activated dialog.
*   **Removal of Photo Zoom Dialog (26/11/2025, 15:38:40 - 15:39:16)**:
    *   The entire `v-dialog` component was removed from the template.
    *   Initially, the `data` properties (`photoDialog`, `selectedEmployee`) and `methods` (`openPhotoZoom`, `closePhotoZoom`) related to the photo zoom dialog were retained in the script, though effectively unused.
    *   Subsequently, these unused `data` properties and methods were completely removed from the script section.
*   **New Avatar Hover Effect (26/11/2025, 15:38:50 - 15:43:09)**:
    *   An `avatar-wrapper` div was introduced around the `v-avatar` element in the template, without immediate styling or functionality.
    *   New CSS styles were later added for `.avatar-wrapper` and `.employee-avatar`. These styles implemented a direct visual hover effect on the avatar: on `hover` of the `avatar-wrapper`, the `employee-avatar` would `transform: scale(3)` and gain a `box-shadow`, accompanied by `z-index` and `transition` properties for smooth scaling and layering.
    *   To accommodate this scaling effect, the `.employee-card` style was modified from `overflow: hidden;` to `overflow: visible;` to prevent the enlarged avatar from being clipped.
    *   The `z-index` for `.avatar-wrapper:hover` was further increased to `9999` to ensure the scaled avatar always appears on top.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Employee Card Structure**: The core layout of employee cards, including `emp_id` and `user_status` chips, name, designation, department, and team details, remained consistent throughout the changes.
*   **Fallback Image**: The default image URL `https://nathanhroperations.s3.amazonaws.com/profile_pics/Sahiba_T/avatar-7.png` was consistently used as a fallback for employee avatars.
*   **Status Color Logic**: The `getStatusColor` method for dynamically coloring status chips (e.g., 'active' as green, 'inactive' as grey) remained unchanged.
*   **Scrolling & Loading**: The infinite scrolling functionality (`onScroll` method, `scrollLoading` prop, `hasMore` prop) and the initial loading state (`loading` prop, `v-skeleton-loader`) were stable components of the design.
*   **User Card Click**: The `handleUserCardClick` method, emitting a `viewUser` event, was consistently maintained.
*   **Avatar Interactivity Evolution**: There's a clear pattern of evolving the avatar's hover/click behavior, moving from a modal photo zoom (first click-based, then hover-based) to a direct CSS-driven scaling animation, suggesting an iterative design process for user interaction.
