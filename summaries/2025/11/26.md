### /Users/collin/projects/ccl/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employment/EmployeeList.vue (Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 12:43:51)

This file represents a Vue component designed to display a list of employees with several key features:

*   **Loading State with Skeletons:** The component incorporates `v-skeleton-loader` to provide a visual loading indicator for employee cards, displaying placeholder content (avatar and text) while employee data is being fetched.
*   **Employee Card Display:** It renders individual `v-card` components for each employee, showing their `emp_id`, `user_status` (with color-coded chips using `getStatusColor` method), `first_name`, `last_name`, `designation`, `department`, and `team`.
*   **User Avatar Management:** Employee avatars are displayed using `v-img`. It includes a fallback default image if `image_url` is missing or fails to load, and applies a grayscale filter to avatars of 'Inactive' users.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Employee details like designation, department, and team are dynamically translated using `$t` and `$te` (translate existing) from `vue-i18n`, combined with a `formatToSnakeCase` helper for flexible key lookups.
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** The component implements an infinite scroll mechanism. The `onScroll` method, attached to the scroll container, detects when the user approaches the bottom and emits a `loadMore` event if more data is available and not currently loading, displaying a `v-progress-circular` at the bottom during subsequent loads.
*   **User Interaction:** Clicking an employee card triggers the `handleUserCardClick` method, which emits a `viewUser` event, passing the selected employee's data.
*   **Active Fetching Indicator:** An overlay with a `v-progress-circular` appears over an employee card if `fetchingEmployee` matches that card's ID, indicating an ongoing operation related to that specific employee.
*   **Styling and Hover Effects:** Employee cards (`employee-card`) feature rounded borders, smooth transitions, and a distinct hover effect that includes multiple box-shadows for depth and a slight `scale(1.025)` transformation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Vuetify Framework:** Extensive use of Vuetify components for UI elements (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-chip`, `v-avatar`, `v-skeleton-loader`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-overlay`).
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Frequent use of `v-if` and `v-else` to manage different states (loading, data loaded, scrolling loading).
*   **Dynamic Data Display:** Data is iterated using `v-for`, and content is dynamically bound to display employee information.
*   **Internationalization:** Consistent application of `$t` and `$te` along with a `formatToSnakeCase` utility to support multi-language content.
*   **Event Emission:** Use of `$emit` for communicating user actions (`loadMore`, `viewUser`) back to parent components.
