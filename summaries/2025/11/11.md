The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`, at two distinct timestamps. This Vue component is responsible for a leave application form.

**File: `/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/components/reuseable/createLeaves.vue`**

*   **Timestamp: 11/11/2025, 09:26:34**
    *   This entry outlines the initial structure and functionality of the `createLeaves.vue` component.
    *   **Template:** It features a complex form for applying for leaves, displaying "No of Days" and "Leave Remaining" counts with specific styling. It includes a conditional alert for "Sick Leave Balance Status" with dynamic colors and icons. Form elements cover leave type selection, a "Leave Option" for half-day requests (conditionally available), start and end date pickers, document upload with required validation, and a reason textarea. The submit button is conditionally enabled/disabled based on various factors, including leave balance.
    *   **Script:**
        *   Initializes `leaves_count` with properties like `no_of_days`, `remaining_leaves`, `balance_message`, `balance_type`, and `total_available_balance`.
        *   Sets up `halfDay` and `nohalfDay` arrays for leave options.
        *   Uses `genericRule` for general form validation and `fileRules` for file uploads.
        *   The `mounted` hook calls `getHolidays()`, `funGetUserPreviosLeaves(this.selectedEmp)`, and `hasApproversFun()`.
        *   `watch` properties are configured for `leave` and `selectedEmp` to trigger `hasApproversFun()` and `funGetUserPreviosLeaves()`.
        *   Methods include `computeLeaveOption()` which dynamically offers "Half Day" only if start and end dates are the same, `formatLeaves()` for number formatting, and `changeToDate()` to set the end date equal to the start date.
        *   The `getLeaveRemaining()` method is a crucial function that makes an asynchronous `POST` request to `/leave/request/remaining/leaves` to fetch the number of days, remaining leaves, attachment requirements, and balance messages based on the selected leave type, dates, and half-day option. It updates the `leaves_count` data and handles snackbar notifications for balance issues.

*   **Timestamp: 11/11/2025, 09:28:35**
    *   This update introduces a minor cosmetic correction in the template. The text "Leave Typesssss" for the leave type selection field was corrected to "Leave Type". No functional changes are evident from this specific log entry.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vuetify Usage:** The component extensively uses Vuetify UI components for a structured and consistent form design, including various layouts (`v-row`, `v-col`), inputs (`v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-file-input`, `v-textarea`), date pickers (`v-date-picker` within `v-menu`), and feedback elements (`v-alert`, `v-snackbar`, `v-progress-linear`).
*   **Dynamic UI and Validation:** There's a strong pattern of dynamic UI updates and validation. Elements are conditionally rendered (`v-if`) or their properties (like `required`, `disabled`, `rules`) are adjusted based on the component's state (`isHalfDayAvailable`, `attachment_required`, `no_balance`, `leave.leave_type.is_reason_optional`).
*   **API Interaction:** The `getLeaveRemaining` method demonstrates a recurring pattern of interacting with a backend API (`/leave/request/remaining/leaves`) to fetch real-time data crucial for form behavior and validation.
*   **State Management:** The component heavily relies on reactive data properties (`data()` block) and `watch` properties to manage the form's state and react to changes in user inputs or `selectedEmp` data.
*   **Date Handling:** Multiple methods and computed properties are involved in handling and formatting dates, including `moment` for date operations.
