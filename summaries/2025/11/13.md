# Activity Summary for 13/11/2025

## 09:38:39
For the file `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/ProcessFlow/GenerateDocument/index.vue`, the changes primarily revolve around the implementation and subsequent removal of an explicit "edit mode" for a document editor, alongside consistent document generation and upload functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **13/11/2025, 08:58:56 (Initial State - fragmented):**
    *   The Vue component provides a dialog for document generation and upload.
    *   It features buttons for "Cancel", "Edit Document", "View Mode", "Save & Upload", and "Create", conditionally displayed based on `current_action.action_type` (either 'document' or 'document upload') and `isEditMode`.
    *   A loading spinner and message are shown during data fetching.
    *   For `action_type === 'document'`, it uses Syncfusion's `ejs-documenteditor` configured to allow editing (`isReadOnly='false'`) and enabled form fields (`enableFormFields='true'`). An informational alert regarding interactive form fields is displayed.
    *   For `action_type === 'document upload'`, it renders various sub-components (e.g., `proposalDocument`, `agreementDocument`, `employementContract`) based on the selected document's name or condition. This section also includes an input for a document number and a drag-and-drop area for PDF file uploads (max 10 MB).
    *   The script imports necessary components, including `DocumentEditorComponent` and related modules from Syncfusion, and registers Syncfusion license keys.
    *   Initial `mounted` logic includes fetching document details and user info. For `action_type === 'document'`, it attempts to open the document editor with SFDT content and calls `configureFormFields()` to set form field shading.

*   **13/11/2025, 08:59:07:**
    *   **Template Change:** The `ejs-documenteditor`'s `isReadOnly` prop was updated from a static `false` to a dynamic `!isEditMode`, making the editor's read-only state toggleable.
    *   **Template Change:** The informational alert for form fields was updated to be conditional on `isEditMode`, showing different messages for view mode and active edit mode.

*   **13/11/2025, 08:59:21:**
    *   **Script Change:** A new data property `isEditMode: false` was explicitly added to the component's `data()` object to manage the document editor's edit state.

*   **13/11/2025, 08:59:43:**
    *   **Script Change:** A new method `enableEditMode()` was introduced, designed to set `this.isEditMode = true` and potentially reconfigure the document editor.

*   **13/11/2025, 09:03:17:**
    *   **Script Change:** Debugging `console.log` statements were added within the `mounted` hook to inspect the structure of SFDT data being loaded into the document editor, specifically checking for the presence of form fields (checkboxes, dropdowns).

*   **13/11/2025, 09:06:10:**
    *   **Template Change:** The `ejs-documenteditor` component reverted its `isReadOnly` prop back to a static `false`, and the `enableFormFields`, `enableOptionsPane`, `enableContextMenu` props were removed. This change effectively disabled the dynamic control over edit mode at the component level.
    *   **Script Change:** The call to `this.configureFormFields()` in the `mounted` hook was removed.

*   **13/11/2025, 09:09:43 (Final State):**
    *   **Template Change:** The "Edit Document" and "View Mode" toggle buttons, along with the `v-alert` messages related to `isEditMode`, were completely removed from the UI.
    *   **Script Change:** The `isEditMode` data property, the `enableEditMode()` method, the `configureFormFields()` method, and the SFDT debugging `console.log` statements were all removed.
    *   A seemingly empty conditional `if (!this.selectedDocument.sfdt) { }` was added within `getDocumentDetails()`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **13/11/2025, 08:59:07 - 08:59:43:** Introduction of dynamic edit mode controls (`isEditMode` data property, UI buttons, conditional alerts, and a new method `enableEditMode`).
*   **13/11/2025, 09:03:17:** Addition of debugging logs to inspect SFDT document structure for form fields.
*   **13/11/2025, 09:06:10 - 09:09:43:** Complete removal of the dynamic edit mode functionality, including UI elements, data properties, methods, and debugging logs. The document editor's `isReadOnly` state returned to a static `false`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Conditional UI Rendering:** The component consistently uses `v-if` and `v-else-if` to switch between a document editor view and a document upload form based on the `current_action.action_type`.
*   **Syncfusion Document Editor:** The `ejs-documenteditor` component is a central feature for document interaction, although its configuration was heavily modified over time.
*   **License Keys:** The `registerLicense` call in the script contains multiple Syncfusion license keys that are present unchanged across all log entries.
*   **Modular Document Handling:** The presence of multiple imported document-specific Vue components (`proposalDocument`, `agreementDocument`, etc.) indicates a modular approach to handling different types of documents during the upload process.
*   **User Feedback:** `SnackBar` components are used for displaying various notifications (success, warning, error) to the user.
*   **Loading Indicators:** A consistent loading animation and text are displayed during asynchronous operations.
