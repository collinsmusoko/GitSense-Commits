# Activity Summary for 13/11/2025

## 09:38:39
For the file `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/ProcessFlow/GenerateDocument/index.vue`, the changes primarily revolve around the implementation and subsequent removal of an explicit "edit mode" for a document editor, alongside consistent document generation and upload functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **13/11/2025, 08:58:56 (Initial State - fragmented):**
    *   The Vue component provides a dialog for document generation and upload.
    *   It features buttons for "Cancel", "Edit Document", "View Mode", "Save & Upload", and "Create", conditionally displayed based on `current_action.action_type` (either 'document' or 'document upload') and `isEditMode`.
    *   A loading spinner and message are shown during data fetching.
    *   For `action_type === 'document'`, it uses Syncfusion's `ejs-documenteditor` configured to allow editing (`isReadOnly='false'`) and enabled form fields (`enableFormFields='true'`). An informational alert regarding interactive form fields is displayed.
    *   For `action_type === 'document upload'`, it renders various sub-components (e.g., `proposalDocument`, `agreementDocument`, `employementContract`) based on the selected document's name or condition. This section also includes an input for a document number and a drag-and-drop area for PDF file uploads (max 10 MB).
    *   The script imports necessary components, including `DocumentEditorComponent` and related modules from Syncfusion, and registers Syncfusion license keys.
    *   Initial `mounted` logic includes fetching document details and user info. For `action_type === 'document'`, it attempts to open the document editor with SFDT content and calls `configureFormFields()` to set form field shading.

*   **13/11/2025, 08:59:07:**
    *   **Template Change:** The `ejs-documenteditor`'s `isReadOnly` prop was updated from a static `false` to a dynamic `!isEditMode`, making the editor's read-only state toggleable.
    *   **Template Change:** The informational alert for form fields was updated to be conditional on `isEditMode`, showing different messages for view mode and active edit mode.

*   **13/11/2025, 08:59:21:**
    *   **Script Change:** A new data property `isEditMode: false` was explicitly added to the component's `data()` object to manage the document editor's edit state.

*   **13/11/2025, 08:59:43:**
    *   **Script Change:** A new method `enableEditMode()` was introduced, designed to set `this.isEditMode = true` and potentially reconfigure the document editor.

*   **13/11/2025, 09:03:17:**
    *   **Script Change:** Debugging `console.log` statements were added within the `mounted` hook to inspect the structure of SFDT data being loaded into the document editor, specifically checking for the presence of form fields (checkboxes, dropdowns).

*   **13/11/2025, 09:06:10:**
    *   **Template Change:** The `ejs-documenteditor` component reverted its `isReadOnly` prop back to a static `false`, and the `enableFormFields`, `enableOptionsPane`, `enableContextMenu` props were removed. This change effectively disabled the dynamic control over edit mode at the component level.
    *   **Script Change:** The call to `this.configureFormFields()` in the `mounted` hook was removed.

*   **13/11/2025, 09:09:43 (Final State):**
    *   **Template Change:** The "Edit Document" and "View Mode" toggle buttons, along with the `v-alert` messages related to `isEditMode`, were completely removed from the UI.
    *   **Script Change:** The `isEditMode` data property, the `enableEditMode()` method, the `configureFormFields()` method, and the SFDT debugging `console.log` statements were all removed.
    *   A seemingly empty conditional `if (!this.selectedDocument.sfdt) { }` was added within `getDocumentDetails()`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **13/11/2025, 08:59:07 - 08:59:43:** Introduction of dynamic edit mode controls (`isEditMode` data property, UI buttons, conditional alerts, and a new method `enableEditMode`).
*   **13/11/2025, 09:03:17:** Addition of debugging logs to inspect SFDT document structure for form fields.
*   **13/11/2025, 09:06:10 - 09:09:43:** Complete removal of the dynamic edit mode functionality, including UI elements, data properties, methods, and debugging logs. The document editor's `isReadOnly` state returned to a static `false`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Conditional UI Rendering:** The component consistently uses `v-if` and `v-else-if` to switch between a document editor view and a document upload form based on the `current_action.action_type`.
*   **Syncfusion Document Editor:** The `ejs-documenteditor` component is a central feature for document interaction, although its configuration was heavily modified over time.
*   **License Keys:** The `registerLicense` call in the script contains multiple Syncfusion license keys that are present unchanged across all log entries.
*   **Modular Document Handling:** The presence of multiple imported document-specific Vue components (`proposalDocument`, `agreementDocument`, etc.) indicates a modular approach to handling different types of documents during the upload process.
*   **User Feedback:** `SnackBar` components are used for displaying various notifications (success, warning, error) to the user.
*   **Loading Indicators:** A consistent loading animation and text are displayed during asynchronous operations.

**Timestamp Overview:**
All logged changes occurred on **13/11/2025**, with timestamps spanning from 14:38:30 to 15:30:15. There are seven entries within this timeframe.

**File-Specific Updates:**
Across all provided log entries for `/Users/collin/projects/binhendi/binhendi-mcs-admin/pages/onboarding/new-employee.vue`, the code content shown is identical. This indicates that within the scope of the provided snippets, no discernible code changes were committed or saved between these timestamps. The log entries effectively represent multiple saves or version control snapshots of the same code state.

**Content Analysis and Recurring Elements:**
The file contains a Vue.js component template, likely implementing a form for "Create New Employee" functionality. It heavily utilizes Vuetify components for its UI structure and input fields.
Key sections and recurring patterns in the form include:

*   **Header and Actions:** A `v-card-title` displaying "Create New Employee" and action buttons for "Cancel" and "Create," with loading states (`:loading="routeLoading"` and `:loading="loading"`).
*   **Form Structure:** The main content is wrapped in a `v-form` with a `ref="onboardingForm"`, organized into `v-row` and `v-col` for responsive layout.
*   **Employee Details Grouping:** The form is logically separated into sections with `span_leadHeading` for 'Personal Details' and 'Employee Details'.
*   **Input Fields:** A consistent use of `v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, and `v-date-picker` components for various data inputs. Many fields are `dense`, `outlined`, and include validation rules (`:rules="genericRule"`, `:rules="emailRules"`, `:rules="phoneNumberRule"`).
*   **Data Binding:** All form fields are two-way bound using `v-model` to an `onboardingUser` object, capturing extensive details such as:
    *   `company_ID`, `flow`, `employment.visa_sponsor`, `employment_type`, `user_location`, `reporting.work_location`
    *   `first_name`, `middle_name`, `last_name`, `email`
    *   Employee ID (`newId`) with a type selector (`selectedEmployeeType`)
    *   `personal.dob` (Date of Birth)
    *   `personal.phone` with a country code selector
    *   `personal.nationality`
    *   `role_ID`, `contract_type`, `reporting.department` (with dynamic team selection based on department), `personal.designation`, `reporting.manager`
    *   `employment.date_of_joining`, `employment.expected_arrival`
    *   `employment.probation_days`, `employment.notice_period` (both with suffix 'Days'/'Day' logic and number type)
    *   `personal.work_schedule` (truncated in the provided snippets)
*   **Image Upload/Display:** A `v-avatar` with `v-img` for displaying or uploading an employee's profile picture, featuring a hover effect to reveal a camera icon (`mdi-camera`) to trigger an input.
*   **Dynamic Data Sources:** Several autocomplete/select components fetch items from `employers`, `translatedFlows`, `configData` (e.g., `visa_sponsors`, `employment_types`, `work_location`, `dept`, `designations`), `locationUae`, `computeNationalities`, `roles`, `contracttypes`, `managers`, `probationMonths`, `noticeMonths`, and `countryCode`.
*   **Date Pickers:** Two `v-menu` components encapsulate `v-date-picker` for date selection (`onboardingUser.personal.dob`, `onboardingUser.employment.date_of_joining`, `onboardingUser.employment.expected_arrival`), each configured with minimum date, locale, and `close-on-content-click`.

The code demonstrates a comprehensive and structured approach to collecting new employee data within a Vue/Vuetify application.
