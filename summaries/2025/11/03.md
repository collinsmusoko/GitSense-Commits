# Activity Summary for 03/11/2025

## 10:51:45
The log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/components/reuseable/claimRequest.vue`.

**File-specific updates:**

The `claimRequest.vue` component, responsible for handling claim request forms, received a specific enhancement related to "Per Diem" claims.

-   **Initial State (03/11/2025, 09:56:26):** The component was structured to display general claim request information (requested date, total amount, description), employee selection, and dynamically render various claim fields based on `claim_keys`. It included specialized layouts for "Per Diem" claims, grouping fields like region/currency, start/end dates with time, and standard rate/total days, along with proration calculation details. Attachment fields had generic validation rules for required status and file size.

-   **Update for Per Diem Attachments (03/11/2025, 10:05:42):** The `attachments` field within the "Per Diem" claim section was significantly updated.
    -   An informational `v-alert` component was added, instructing the user: "Please attach the Approved Business Travel Form". This alert is conditionally displayed only for "Per Diem" claim subtypes.
    -   The validation rules for the `v-file-input` were made more specific for "Per Diem" claims. If the claim is a "Per Diem" subtype, the required message for the attachment now explicitly states "Approved Business Travel Form is required" instead of the previous generic "File is required". General file size validation (less than 2 MB) remains consistent.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

-   **03/11/2025, 09:56:26:** Establishes the baseline structure and logic for the `claimRequest.vue` component, including general form fields, dynamic rendering of claim-specific fields, and specialized layouts for Per Diem claims.
-   **03/11/2025, 10:05:42:** Introduces a targeted improvement for the "Per Diem" claim attachment handling by adding a user instruction alert and refining the validation message to be more specific to the "Approved Business Travel Form".

All subsequent timestamps (03/11/2025, 10:06:12; 03/11/2025, 10:21:21; 03/11/2025, 10:21:40; 03/11/2025, 10:35:29; 03/11/2025, 10:35:42; 03/11/2025, 10:50:19; 03/11/2025, 10:50:30) show identical code to the 10:05:42 version. This indicates that the core changes were applied in the 10:05:42 commit, and subsequent entries might represent saves or minor, unlogged edits that didn't alter the provided snippets.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

-   **Vue.js and Vuetify:** The code consistently uses Vue.js templating with Vuetify components for UI elements (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-file-input`, `v-alert`, `v-progress-circular`).
-   **Dynamic Form Rendering:** The form fields are largely dynamic, generated by iterating over `claimreq.claim_keys` and conditionally rendering different input types (`textfield`, `numberfield`, `select`, `dateandtimepicker`, `attachments`, `textarea`).
-   **Conditional UI Logic:** Extensive use of `v-if` for displaying specific sections (e.g., loader, employee selection, claim deletion for subsequent claims, Per Diem-specific layouts, proration details).
-   **Per Diem Specialization:** There's a strong pattern of conditional logic (`v-if="hasDiem(claimreq.claimSubType)"`) to render distinct layouts and apply specific validation rules for "Per Diem" claims. This includes pairing related fields (region/currency, start/end dates, standard rate/total days) into single rows and displaying proration details.
-   **Required Field Indicators:** Most input fields include a `<span class="red--text">*</span>` next to their label, indicating a required field.
-   **Loading and Disabled States:** Elements consistently include `:disabled="showLoader || isDraftRequest"` attributes, and a global `loader-wrapper` is present, suggesting robust handling of form submission and draft states.
-   **Consistent Styling:** Many input fields are styled with the `redTextForm` class, indicating a shared visual theme.
-   **File Input Validation:** All `v-file-input` components include validation rules to limit file size to 2 MB and check for required status.
