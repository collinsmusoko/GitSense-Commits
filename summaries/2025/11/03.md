# Activity Summary for 03/11/2025

## 10:51:45
The log details changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/components/reuseable/claimRequest.vue`.

**File-specific updates:**

The `claimRequest.vue` component, responsible for handling claim request forms, received a specific enhancement related to "Per Diem" claims.

-   **Initial State (03/11/2025, 09:56:26):** The component was structured to display general claim request information (requested date, total amount, description), employee selection, and dynamically render various claim fields based on `claim_keys`. It included specialized layouts for "Per Diem" claims, grouping fields like region/currency, start/end dates with time, and standard rate/total days, along with proration calculation details. Attachment fields had generic validation rules for required status and file size.

-   **Update for Per Diem Attachments (03/11/2025, 10:05:42):** The `attachments` field within the "Per Diem" claim section was significantly updated.
    -   An informational `v-alert` component was added, instructing the user: "Please attach the Approved Business Travel Form". This alert is conditionally displayed only for "Per Diem" claim subtypes.
    -   The validation rules for the `v-file-input` were made more specific for "Per Diem" claims. If the claim is a "Per Diem" subtype, the required message for the attachment now explicitly states "Approved Business Travel Form is required" instead of the previous generic "File is required". General file size validation (less than 2 MB) remains consistent.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

-   **03/11/2025, 09:56:26:** Establishes the baseline structure and logic for the `claimRequest.vue` component, including general form fields, dynamic rendering of claim-specific fields, and specialized layouts for Per Diem claims.
-   **03/11/2025, 10:05:42:** Introduces a targeted improvement for the "Per Diem" claim attachment handling by adding a user instruction alert and refining the validation message to be more specific to the "Approved Business Travel Form".

All subsequent timestamps (03/11/2025, 10:06:12; 03/11/2025, 10:21:21; 03/11/2025, 10:21:40; 03/11/2025, 10:35:29; 03/11/2025, 10:35:42; 03/11/2025, 10:50:19; 03/11/2025, 10:50:30) show identical code to the 10:05:42 version. This indicates that the core changes were applied in the 10:05:42 commit, and subsequent entries might represent saves or minor, unlogged edits that didn't alter the provided snippets.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

-   **Vue.js and Vuetify:** The code consistently uses Vue.js templating with Vuetify components for UI elements (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-file-input`, `v-alert`, `v-progress-circular`).
-   **Dynamic Form Rendering:** The form fields are largely dynamic, generated by iterating over `claimreq.claim_keys` and conditionally rendering different input types (`textfield`, `numberfield`, `select`, `dateandtimepicker`, `attachments`, `textarea`).
-   **Conditional UI Logic:** Extensive use of `v-if` for displaying specific sections (e.g., loader, employee selection, claim deletion for subsequent claims, Per Diem-specific layouts, proration details).
-   **Per Diem Specialization:** There's a strong pattern of conditional logic (`v-if="hasDiem(claimreq.claimSubType)"`) to render distinct layouts and apply specific validation rules for "Per Diem" claims. This includes pairing related fields (region/currency, start/end dates, standard rate/total days) into single rows and displaying proration details.
-   **Required Field Indicators:** Most input fields include a `<span class="red--text">*</span>` next to their label, indicating a required field.
-   **Loading and Disabled States:** Elements consistently include `:disabled="showLoader || isDraftRequest"` attributes, and a global `loader-wrapper` is present, suggesting robust handling of form submission and draft states.
-   **Consistent Styling:** Many input fields are styled with the `redTextForm` class, indicating a shared visual theme.
-   **File Input Validation:** All `v-file-input` components include validation rules to limit file size to 2 MB and check for required status.

## 11:53:01
The log details a series of iterative changes to the `/Users/collin/projects/art-jameel/art-jameel.admin/components/reuseable/claimRequest.vue` file, focusing primarily on enhancements to the attachment handling and Per Diem claim specific logic. All changes occurred on March 11, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **03/11/2025, 10:05:42**: A significant update introduced a conditional `v-alert` instruction note for "Per Diem" claim sub-types within the attachment section. This alert, which reads "Please attach the Approved Business Travel Form", appears only when `hasDiem(claimreq.claimSubType)` is true. Alongside this, the validation rules for the `v-file-input` were made conditional: requiring "Approved Business Travel Form is required" for Per Diem claims and the more general "File is required" otherwise.
*   **03/11/2025, 10:50:30**: A minor text change was implemented in the attachment field's label. The prefix for the attachment name changed from no prefix to "Add", e.g., "Add [Attachment Name]".
*   **03/11/2025, 11:02:37**: Further refinements to the attachment field occurred. The "Add" prefix in the label was changed to "Attach" (e.g., "Attach [Attachment Name]"). The `v-alert` instruction note for Per Diem claims received styling adjustments, specifically a smaller font size (`font-size: 0.75rem;`) and adjusted margins (`mb-2 mt-1`, `mr-1` for the icon). There was also a slight refinement in the column sizing logic for remaining fields, although the `cols`, `sm`, and `md` values for `textarea` types remained functionally consistent.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The most significant functional change, introducing the conditional alert and specific validation rules for Per Diem attachments, happened around **03/11/2025, 10:05:42**. Subsequent timestamps (10:50:30 and 11:02:37) indicate minor textual and styling refinements to this same feature. The entries between 10:06:12 and 10:50:19 appear to be saves without substantial content changes in the provided snippets.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Conditional Rendering:** A strong pattern is the extensive use of `v-if` and `v-for` to dynamically render different field types and layouts based on `claimreq.claimSubType` (especially `hasDiem`) and `claimkey.type` (e.g., `textfield`, `numberfield`, `dateandtimepicker`, `attachments`, `textarea`).
*   **Vuetify Components:** The code heavily leverages Vuetify components such as `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-form`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-textarea`, `v-text-field`, `v-menu`, `v-date-picker`, `v-select`, `v-file-input`, `v-tooltip`, `v-stepper`, `v-icon`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-card`, and `v-alert`.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Recurring CSS classes like `grey-heading-text`, `font-weight-medium`, `textFontSize`, and `redTextForm` are used across various elements for a consistent UI.
*   **Disabled State:** Form inputs are consistently disabled when `showLoader` or `isDraftRequest` is true, indicating a mechanism for preventing user interaction during loading or for draft requests.
*   **Dynamic Data Binding:** `v-model.trim` is frequently used for two-way data binding with trimmed input, and dynamic rules arrays (`:rules="claimkey?.required? genericRule : []"`) are common for validation.
*   **Per Diem Special Handling:** There's a dedicated section and logic for "Per Diem" claims, including specific field pairings (Region/Currency, Start/End Date with Time, Standard Rate/Total Days), a "Proration Calculation Details" card, and specialized validation/instructions for attachments.
