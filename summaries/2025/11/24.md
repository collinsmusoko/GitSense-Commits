# Activity Summary for 24/11/2025

## 02:08:02
The provided log details a series of changes across three main files: `EmployeeManagement.tsx`, `page.tsx` (user-management), `layout.tsx` (user), and `globals.css`. The timestamps indicate active development on November 23, 2025, from early morning to late afternoon.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/components/user-management/EmployeeManagement.tsx`** (Frequent changes from 05:00:43 to 18:22:23)
    *   **Initial State (around 05:00:43 - 05:01:12):** This component is responsible for employee management, including fetching and displaying user data, filtering, and showing gender statistics. It uses Redux for state management (`fetchUsers`, `clearError`, `selectUsers`, `selectUsersLoading`, `selectUsersError`) and local state for UI elements like search queries (`searchQuery`), advanced search visibility (`showAdvancedSearch`), and an "add user" modal (`showAddUserModal`). Gender statistics are mocked using a placeholder `first_name` filter. The UI incorporates a search bar, gender stats display, and action buttons, with conditional rendering for advanced search filters, error alerts, and loading/empty states for user cards.
    *   **Styling Consistency (05:01:03):** A minor update changed the loading spinner's `border-b-2` color from `border-blue-600` to `border-[#b98036]`, aligning with a custom bronze color palette. This color (`#b98036`) appears frequently in interactive elements.
    *   **Action Button Refinement (13:47:13):** Most action buttons (like export, import) were removed, leaving only the "add user" button visible.
    *   **Add User Modal Logic & UI Introduction (13:56:32 - 17:59:47):** Significant changes were introduced to implement the "Add New Employee" modal functionality.
        *   **Local State Expansion:** New state variables `activeTab` (for 'personal', 'employment', 'compensation' tabs within the modal) and `formData` (a large object to hold detailed new employee information across these categories) were added.
        *   **Modal Structure:** The modal was designed with a fixed header (title, close button), fixed tab navigation, and a scrollable content area for form fields.
        *   **Styling Updates:** The modal header transitioned from a `bg-gradient-to-r from-bronze-500 to-bronze-700` background to a `bg-white` background with a more subtle appearance, and the tab indicators were updated to use a circular background with icons and a bottom border for the active tab. Color changes from `blue-600` to `bronze-600` were made in the tab navigation for better thematic consistency.
        *   **Input Styling:** Form fields within the modal initially used `border-gray-300 rounded-lg` with `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-bronze-500`, then later transitioned to a `border-0 border-b-2 border-gray-300 focus:outline-none focus:border-blue-500` style, indicating a shift to bottom-border-only inputs.
        *   **Modal Refinement:** The modal's positioning changed from `absolute inset-0` to `fixed inset-0` with an overlay, indicating a desire for a global, centered modal rather than one relative to its parent. The internal scrollable content area `max-height` was adjusted several times.
    *   **Modularization of AddNewUserModal (17:24:20 - 18:22:23):** The complex "Add New User" modal logic and UI were extracted into a new reusable component, `AddNewUserModal.tsx`. The `EmployeeManagement.tsx` component now imports and uses this new modal component, simplifying its own rendering logic for the modal and handling submissions via a `handleUserSubmit` prop. The internal `activeTab` and `formData` states were moved into the `AddNewUserModal` component.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/app/user/user-management/page.tsx`** (Changes at 05:04:53, 05:05:02, 13:37:36, 13:39:27, 16:40:55)
    *   **Initial Setup (05:04:53):** This page component handles navigation between different user management sections (`userCentral`, `empManage`, `empRequest`, `surveys`, `performance`). It uses Next.js `useRouter` for navigation and `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo` for state and memoization. Card configurations are defined with `id`, `title`, `description`, `icon`, `icon2`, `color`, and `order`. URL fragments are used to manage the active section.
    *   **Styling Adjustments (05:05:02, 13:37:36, 13:39:27, 16:40:55):** The primary color for the active navigation card (`from-[#6488EE] to-[#0918F7]`) was updated to a `from-[#b98036] to-[#8a5f28]` gradient. Later, this was updated to `from-bronze-500 to-bronze-700` after the `globals.css` introduced custom bronze shades. The `z-index` of the sticky navigation was also adjusted from `z-50` to `z-40`.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/app/user/layout.tsx`** (Changes from 05:14:14 to 05:21:30)
    *   **Sidebar Navigation (05:14:14):** This layout component provides the main dashboard structure, including a responsive sidebar. It utilizes Redux to fetch user profile (`fetchUserProfile`) and auth status, and integrates role-based access control (`getAccessibleNavItems`, `hasAccess`). Navigation items are defined with `name`, `href`, `icon`, `accessTag`, and `description`. The sidebar's visibility is managed via `isSidebarOpen` and `isMobile` states, adapting to screen size changes.
    *   **Styling Adjustments (05:18:49 - 05:21:30):** The `hover` state background color for navigation links in the sidebar was refined. Initially, `hover:bg-[#b98036] hover:bg-opacity-10 hover:text-[#b98036]` changed to `hover:bg-bronze-100 hover:text-gray-600`, and then to `hover:bg-bronze-100 hover:text-bronze-700` and `isActive` color to `bg-bronze-500`, reflecting the introduction and consistent application of custom bronze Tailwind CSS colors.

4.  **`/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_media_admin/src/app/globals.css`** (Change at 05:29:29)
    *   **Custom Colors Introduction:** This file was updated to define custom CSS variables for a "bronze" color palette (`--color-bronze-50` to `--color-bronze-950`). This indicates a new design system or brand color being implemented across the application, particularly in UI components. The `@theme inline` block suggests integration with a theming system.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent Timestamp Grouping:** Changes are grouped around two main timeframes on November 23, 2025: early morning (05:00:xx) and later in the day (13:xx:xx - 18:xx:xx). This suggests distinct development sessions.
*   **Refactoring and Modularization:** A clear pattern of UI refinement and code modularization is observed, particularly with the `EmployeeManagement.tsx` component. The "Add New User" modal was initially integrated directly into `EmployeeManagement.tsx` and then extracted into a separate, reusable `AddNewUserModal.tsx` component.
*   **Styling Consistency and Customization:** There's a recurring effort to standardize UI colors, moving from specific hex codes (e.g., `#b98036`) to named custom Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bronze-500`, `bronze-700`), enabled by the definition of these colors in `globals.css`.
*   **Responsive Design Focus:** The `DashboardLayout.tsx` shows continuous consideration for responsive design, with specific logic for mobile vs. desktop sidebar behavior.
*   **Redux Integration:** All React components consistently use `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` from Redux hooks for state management, indicating a strong adherence to a Redux-based architecture.
*   **Placeholder Logic:** The `EmployeeManagement.tsx` component still contains placeholder logic for gender calculation and API calls (`// TODO: Implement API call to create user`, `user.first_name?.toLowerCase().includes('a')`), suggesting these features are still under active development or awaiting backend integration.
