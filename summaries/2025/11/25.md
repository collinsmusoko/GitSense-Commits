# Activity Summary for 25/11/2025

## 09:20:00
The log details multiple changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`.

**File-specific updates:**
All entries for `employment.vue` contain identical code content. The code describes a Vue component featuring an "Add New User" interface and an employee directory with search, filtering, and data export functionalities. Key elements include:
*   A conditional rendering block for adding a new user (`addUserFlag`).
*   A detailed employee overview section with search, male/female employee counts and percentages, and action buttons for "Check Fields," "Expiry Documents," "Bulk Salary Adjustment," and "Download Database."
*   An "Advance Search" filter section that displays active filter chips (e.g., ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, date of joining, last working day).

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The provided log shows four entries for the same file, with timestamps:
*   25/11/2025, 09:01:13
*   25/11/2025, 09:02:18
*   25/11/2025, 09:03:50
*   25/11/2025, 09:14:51

Despite these distinct timestamps, the code content presented in each log entry is precisely the same. This indicates that either no functional code changes were made to the `<template>` section across these updates, or any changes were reverted, or the provided snippets are incomplete and actual changes occurred in other parts of the Vue component (e.g., `<script>` or `<style>`). Based solely on the provided log, there are no code differences between these timestamps.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**
*   **Vue.js Component Structure:** The file consistently follows a standard Vue.js single-file component `<template>` structure using Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-card-title`, `v-img`, `v-btn`, `v-text-field`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-tooltip`, `v-icon`, `v-chip`).
*   **User Management UI:** The component focuses on employment management, including adding users, displaying employee statistics (male/female counts), and providing advanced search and filtering capabilities.
*   **Styling and Icons:** Consistent use of specific image assets (e.g., `/hr/claim.svg`, `/dashboard/close.svg`, `/adminCentral/maleEmployees.svg`, `/adminCentral/femaleEmployees.svg`, `/adminCentral/expiry.svg`, `/profile/upload.svg`, `/directory/add_plus.svg`) and Material Design Icons (e.g., `mdi-magnify`, `mdi-account-search`, `mdi-account-filter-outline`) for UI elements.
*   **Data Binding and Conditional Rendering:** Extensive use of `v-if`, `v-model`, `:min-height`, `:max-height`, `:class`, `@click`, `:style`, and various props for child components (`AddNew`).
*   **Filter Chips:** A prominent feature is the dynamic display of applied filters as `v-chip` components, which can be dismissed individually.

## 12:20:07
The log indicates multiple entries for the file `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 09:01:13 and 12:18:36 on 25/11/2025. However, a detailed comparison of the provided code snippets reveals that the content of this file remained entirely unchanged across all recorded timestamps.

The file contains a Vue.js template for an "Employment" component within an admin central section. Key elements include:
*   A conditional rendering (`v-if="addUserFlag == true"`) for an "Add New User" card, which uses a child component `AddNew`.
*   A main view (`v-else`) featuring a search bar (`v-text-field v-model="search"`), employee statistics (male/female counts and percentages, conditionally rendered based on `userfetch`), and various action buttons (e.g., "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", "Download Database", and "Add User").
*   An "Advance Search" tooltip and a section displaying active filter chips (`v-chip`) for employee attributes like ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, and date filters (DOJ, LWD).

Despite multiple timestamps, no modifications, additions, or deletions to the code were made in any of the provided entries. The timestamps seem to reflect saves or automated logging rather than actual content updates.

## 13:21:17
The provided log details changes across two distinct files, predominantly focusing on an administrative employment component and a backend service for employment detail adjustments.

### File: `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-api/src/services/employment_details_adjustment.service.js`
**Timestamp of significant change:** 25/11/2025, 12:49:20

This file, a backend service for handling employment detail adjustments, received substantial functional updates.
The `createRequest` function was enhanced to:
*   Perform more robust validation for users and managers.
*   Implement dynamic mapping of "line_manager_id" and "senior_manager_id" within approval levels based on the applicant's reporting structure.
*   Include logic to eliminate duplicate approvers and adjust the `required_number` of approvals dynamically.
*   Ensure proper creation and saving of the `EmploymentDetailsAdjustment` request.
*   Send email and push notifications to relevant approvers. An email notification for the applicant is prepared but commented out.

The `approveRequest` function was also significantly modified to introduce a new, detailed update mechanism based on the `request_category` field from the adjustment request:
*   It now handles different types of updates:
    *   **"document update"**: Dynamically updates user document details (e.g., `qatar_id`, `special_work_permit`, or generic documents) including document number, expiry, issue date, and URL, after verifying the document type against a `Configuration` model. Error logging is included for unconfigured document types.
    *   **"personal information"**: Updates fields like `first_name`, `last_name`, `middle_name`, `personal` object, and `socials` object.
    *   **"emergency contact"**: Updates the `emergency` contact object.
    *   **"bank details"**: Updates the `bank` details object.
    *   **"medical"**: Updates `allergies` and `blood_group` within the user's `personal` information.
    *   **"insurance"**: Updates the `insurance` object.
    *   **"dependents"**: Updates the `sponsored_dependents` array.
    *   **"employment details"**: Handles updates to the `employment` object and the `company_ID` at the root level of the user document.

### File: `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`
**Timestamps of noted activity:** Between 25/11/2025, 09:01:13 and 25/11/2025, 13:18:35

This Vue component represents an administrative interface for managing employment details. Across multiple logged timestamps, the content of this file remained entirely unchanged. The component displays:
*   A section for adding new users, utilizing an `AddNew` component.
*   An employee overview section (initially commented out in the provided logs, showing placeholders for "All Employees", "Active Users", "Inactive Users" counts).
*   A search bar for employees by name or tags.
*   Statistics for male and female employees, including counts and percentages.
*   Action buttons for "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", "Download Database", and adding a new user.
*   An "Advance Search" toggle and a display area for active filter chips (e.g., ID, Status, Employee Name, Email, Designation, Department, Cost Center, Job Group, Team, Date of Joining, Last Working Date).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The most striking pattern is the repeated logging of the `employment.vue` file without any content changes over an extended period (from 09:01:13 to 13:18:35). This suggests either frequent saves of an unmodified file, an automated process touching the file, or a version control system recording states where no functional difference occurred. The detailed content of this file consistently showcases a comprehensive employee management dashboard with filtering capabilities and administrative actions.

In contrast, the `employment_details_adjustment.service.js` file shows a single, significant update event, introducing complex logic for handling various types of employment detail change requests and their approval workflows. This indicates a backend enhancement to support a flexible data modification process for user profiles.

## 14:20:14
The provided log details code changes across two files: `employment.vue` and `employment_details_adjustment.service.js`, and one utility file: `filters.js`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`**
    *   **Timestamp of first appearance**: 25/11/2025, 09:01:13
    *   **Summary of content**: This is a Vue component for managing employment details within an admin central dashboard. It includes:
        *   A conditional "Add New User" form, rendering the `AddNew` component with various props related to user data, company, roles, request types, and approvers.
        *   The main view contains a search bar (`v-text-field` with `mdi-magnify` icon).
        *   Employee statistics, showing male and female employee counts and percentages, with conditional rendering based on a `userfetch` flag.
        *   Several action buttons/icons for "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment" (with an upload icon), "Download Database" (with a custom SVG icon), and "Add New User".
        *   An "Advance Search" section with filter chips that display active filters for employee ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, and date ranges (DOJ, LWD).
    *   **Changes across timestamps**: No functional code changes were observed in this file across any of the provided timestamps (from 09:01:13 to 13:18:35). All entries for this file show identical content, indicating either no save-worthy changes were made, or only whitespace/trivial changes not captured by this diff method were present.

2.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-api/src/services/employment_details_adjustment.service.js`**
    *   **Timestamp of first appearance**: 25/11/2025, 12:49:20
    *   **Summary of content**: This Node.js service file handles the creation and approval of employment details adjustment requests.
        *   The `createRequest` function validates user/manager existence, checks for active approval flows, dynamically maps approvers (e.g., line manager, senior manager), creates a new request in the `Requests` collection, and sends email/in-app notifications to approvers and the applicant.
        *   The `approveRequest` function processes approved requests. It updates the request status and, more significantly, applies changes to the `User` document based on the `request_category`. This includes dynamic updates for document types (like 'qatar_id', 'special_work_permit' that update `documents.qatar_id.document_number`, etc., based on `Configuration`), personal information, emergency contact, bank details, medical details (allergies, blood group), insurance, dependents, and core employment details.
    *   **Changes across timestamps**: No functional code changes were observed in this file across the provided timestamps (from 12:49:20 to 13:26:21). Both entries for this file show identical content.

3.  **`/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/plugins/filters.js`**
    *   **Timestamp of first appearance**: 25/11/2025, 13:27:16
    *   **Summary of content**: This file defines global Vue filters for formatting various data types. It includes filters for standard dates, time, dashboard dates, payroll dates, date parts (day, month, year), amounts with thousand separators and annotations (K, M, G), and text capitalization. Notably, the `formatDDMY` filter contains robust error handling for invalid or empty date values.
    *   **Timestamp of significant change**: 25/11/2025, 13:28:01
    *   **Key changes**: Two new Vue filters were added:
        *   `formatDDMMYYYYHHmmss`: Formats a date-time string into `DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss A` format.
        *   `PayslipDateFormatter`: Formats a date string (expected 'YYYY/MM') into `MMM, YYYY` format, though the provided code for this filter is incomplete.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Timestamp Pattern**: Most files show no changes across multiple timestamps, suggesting repetitive saving or logging without actual code modifications. A single block of timestamps (around 13:27-13:28) indicates an actual functional change in `filters.js`.
*   **Vue Component Design**: The `employment.vue` file consistently uses Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-chip`, `v-btn`, `v-icon`, `v-img`, `v-tooltip`) for UI layout and functionality, including conditional rendering (`v-if`) and event handling (`@click`). It follows a pattern of showing aggregated data (employee counts), search functionality, and advanced filtering with selectable chips.
*   **Date/Time Formatting**: The `filters.js` file demonstrates a strong emphasis on various date and time formatting utilities using the `moment.js` library, highlighting a recurring need for diverse display formats throughout the application.
*   **Request/Approval Workflow**: The `employment_details_adjustment.service.js` file shows a common backend pattern for handling requests, involving fetching related data (users, companies, approval configurations), dynamic approval routing, persisting the request, and sending notifications. The update logic for `User` documents based on approved request categories is a significant part of this workflow.
