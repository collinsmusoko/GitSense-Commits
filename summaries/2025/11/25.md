# Activity Summary for 25/11/2025

## 09:20:00
The log details multiple changes to a single file: `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue`.

**File-specific updates:**
All entries for `employment.vue` contain identical code content. The code describes a Vue component featuring an "Add New User" interface and an employee directory with search, filtering, and data export functionalities. Key elements include:
*   A conditional rendering block for adding a new user (`addUserFlag`).
*   A detailed employee overview section with search, male/female employee counts and percentages, and action buttons for "Check Fields," "Expiry Documents," "Bulk Salary Adjustment," and "Download Database."
*   An "Advance Search" filter section that displays active filter chips (e.g., ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, date of joining, last working day).

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The provided log shows four entries for the same file, with timestamps:
*   25/11/2025, 09:01:13
*   25/11/2025, 09:02:18
*   25/11/2025, 09:03:50
*   25/11/2025, 09:14:51

Despite these distinct timestamps, the code content presented in each log entry is precisely the same. This indicates that either no functional code changes were made to the `<template>` section across these updates, or any changes were reverted, or the provided snippets are incomplete and actual changes occurred in other parts of the Vue component (e.g., `<script>` or `<style>`). Based solely on the provided log, there are no code differences between these timestamps.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**
*   **Vue.js Component Structure:** The file consistently follows a standard Vue.js single-file component `<template>` structure using Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-card-title`, `v-img`, `v-btn`, `v-text-field`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-tooltip`, `v-icon`, `v-chip`).
*   **User Management UI:** The component focuses on employment management, including adding users, displaying employee statistics (male/female counts), and providing advanced search and filtering capabilities.
*   **Styling and Icons:** Consistent use of specific image assets (e.g., `/hr/claim.svg`, `/dashboard/close.svg`, `/adminCentral/maleEmployees.svg`, `/adminCentral/femaleEmployees.svg`, `/adminCentral/expiry.svg`, `/profile/upload.svg`, `/directory/add_plus.svg`) and Material Design Icons (e.g., `mdi-magnify`, `mdi-account-search`, `mdi-account-filter-outline`) for UI elements.
*   **Data Binding and Conditional Rendering:** Extensive use of `v-if`, `v-model`, `:min-height`, `:max-height`, `:class`, `@click`, `:style`, and various props for child components (`AddNew`).
*   **Filter Chips:** A prominent feature is the dynamic display of applied filters as `v-chip` components, which can be dismissed individually.

## 12:20:07
The log indicates multiple entries for the file `/Users/collin/projects/hec/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 09:01:13 and 12:18:36 on 25/11/2025. However, a detailed comparison of the provided code snippets reveals that the content of this file remained entirely unchanged across all recorded timestamps.

The file contains a Vue.js template for an "Employment" component within an admin central section. Key elements include:
*   A conditional rendering (`v-if="addUserFlag == true"`) for an "Add New User" card, which uses a child component `AddNew`.
*   A main view (`v-else`) featuring a search bar (`v-text-field v-model="search"`), employee statistics (male/female counts and percentages, conditionally rendered based on `userfetch`), and various action buttons (e.g., "Check Fields", "Expiry Documents", "Bulk Salary Adjustment", "Download Database", and "Add User").
*   An "Advance Search" tooltip and a section displaying active filter chips (`v-chip`) for employee attributes like ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team, and date filters (DOJ, LWD).

Despite multiple timestamps, no modifications, additions, or deletions to the code were made in any of the provided entries. The timestamps seem to reflect saves or automated logging rather than actual content updates.
