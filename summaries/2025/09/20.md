# Activity Summary for 20/09/2025

## 16:42:29
On 20/09/2025 at 15:41:46, a significant update was made to `/Users/collin/projects/tat/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/models.py`. This update involved the creation or substantial revision of Django models for users, profiles, departments, and employees within a system likely managing employee information and organizational structure.

The `User` model extends Django's `AbstractUser`, adding a `role` field with choices for 'admin', 'moderator', and 'writer'.  The `Profile` model is a one-to-one extension of the `User` model, containing extensive personal information fields (bio, profile picture, contact details, emergency contacts, etc.),  marital status, gender, and nationality.  Crucially, it includes calculated properties for `age` and `full_name`.

A `Department` model manages organizational departments, including a foreign key to a `User` representing the department head. It features properties to calculate `employee_count` and  `head_name`.  Finally, an `Employee` model provides details specific to employment, including employee ID, department, position, employment status, compensation, and reporting structure.  Calculated properties provide `is_active`, `years_of_service`, `manager_name`, and `department_name`.  Methods `get_direct_reports` and `get_all_subordinates` allow for hierarchical reporting structure traversal.

Throughout the models, extensive use of choices for fields like role, marital status, gender, employment status, and salary type is observed, promoting data integrity and consistency.  Timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) are included in both `Profile` and `Employee` models for tracking changes.  The code uses Django's features such as `models.CharField`, `models.ForeignKey`, `models.OneToOneField`, and validators for input validation.
