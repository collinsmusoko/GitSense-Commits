# Activity Summary for 04/09/2025

## 10:53:44
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/reuseable/letter/index.vue` file between 10:09:56 and 10:12:18 on April 9, 2025.  The changes are primarily focused on styling and presentation within the Vue component.

The most significant changes are in the styling of the file upload section.  Initially, the text " {{ $t("myhr.myhr_upload_documents") }}" had a class `textFontSize`. This class was removed in a subsequent commit and then the text  was given new styling classes  `grey-heading-text font-weight-medium textFontSize` in the final commit.  These alterations suggest improvements to the visual appeal and consistency of the UI.  There are no functional changes to the file upload logic itself.  Other minor styling adjustments were also made to the text field labels.  The core functionality of the component (letter selection, field input, file upload, and submission) remained consistent across all revisions.  The  `handleSubmit` method shows the component sends a POST request to `/letter/request/new/v2` to submit a new letter request.

The log shows two commits to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/reuseable/letterPreview.vue`, both within a minute of each other on April 9th, 2025.  The changes are minor.  The second commit (11:43:23) adds a translated heading `<h3>{{ $t("my_team.preview") }}</h3>` to the top of the component,  presumably for improved internationalization. The rest of the component's structure, including the rendering of letter content (date, address, subject, body, signature, stamp, and footer), remains the same across both commits.  The component uses a Vue.js framework with a substantial amount of styling in its `<style>` tag, suggesting a rich user interface.  No functional changes are evident; only a textual addition for improved user experience or localization.
