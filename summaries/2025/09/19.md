# Activity Summary for 19/09/2025

## 10:02:16
The log shows multiple updates to components of a document configuration system, spanning both the front-end (Vue.js components) and back-end (Node.js API services).

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/app.js` file, updated at `19/09/2025, 09:18:56`, is the main application file for the API.  It uses Express.js with numerous middleware for security (helmet, cors, xss, compression),  request body handling, and authentication (passport.js with JWT strategy).  Crucially, it sets up BullMQ for background jobs related to attendance, bulk user uploads, and leave balances.  Error handling middleware is also defined.  Scheduled jobs (`scheduleUserChecks`, `updateOrgChart`, `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder`) are initiated at startup.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` file undergoes multiple revisions between `19/09/2025, 09:27:00` and `19/09/2025, 09:42:36`. These changes center around refining the UI for managing document types.  The component uses Vuetify for its UI framework.  Significant changes include improved handling of email templates for expiry reminders, including adding a dialog for creating/editing templates and enhancing error handling and validation.  The most substantial changes are in the email template management section, adding features like a preview, available placeholders, and loading states.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` file is updated twice, at `19/09/2025, 09:42:30` and `19/09/2025, 10:00:41`. This file appears to be the main view component for the document configuration section. Updates here involve adding filtering and sorting capabilities to the document list and improving error handling in the `handleSubmit` method. The error handling now includes validation checks to ensure all required fields are filled before submitting data.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` file is also revised multiple times, between `19/09/2025, 09:54:09` and `19/09/2025, 09:55:33`.  This file contains the backend logic for handling document configurations.  The changes focus on the `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function, which is simplified by removing some console logs and minor adjustments to the error handling.  The core functionality of sending notifications and emails remains the same, sending notifications to both the user and their manager.


In summary, the code changes reflect an iterative refinement process focused on improving both the user interface for configuring document types and enhancing the robustness of the backend API. A key theme is the addition of features related to email-based expiry reminders, including creation and management of templates and a detailed process for sending notifications. The improvements suggest a focus on user experience and data integrity.

The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js`.

**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue`:** This file, a Vue.js component, underwent two significant changes.  The first at `19/09/2025, 10:34:07` introduced a UI for managing document configurations, including basic details (type, applicability, category, description) and settings (required, expiry, expiry reminders, supported file types, maximum file size, image ratio). The second change at `19/09/2025, 10:58:54` appears to be a minor update, as the code is largely identical to the previous version;  no functional changes are readily apparent.


**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js`:**  This file, containing backend services for document configuration, shows a series of edits focused on the `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function.

Initially (`19/09/2025, 10:35:38`), this function sent email notifications and database notifications for document expiry reminders, including handling cases with and without reporting managers.  The function was then modified several times (`19/09/2025, 10:53:08`, `19/09/2025, 10:53:26`, `19/09/2025, 10:56:27`, `19/09/2025, 11:00:04`, `19/09/2025, 11:00:19`, `19/09/2025, 11:00:37`) between `10:53:08` and `11:00:37`.  These revisions primarily involved adding extensive logging statements to track the notification process, making the code easier to debug.  There were also minor adjustments to error handling and the way email templates were handled. The changes between `10:54:09` and `10:54:37` were empty commits, suggesting potential interruptions or abandoned changes. The final version reverted back to a previous version, removing added logging and email sending to user and instead, reverting to a previous version that only sent notification to reporting managers and the user.  The core functionality of sending notifications and emails remained consistent across most versions.  The changes between `10:35:38` and `10:56:27` are significant, showing the addition of email sending to both the user and the user's reporting manager. The code is largely consistent between `10:56:27` and `11:00:37`, indicating finalization of the improved notification system.
