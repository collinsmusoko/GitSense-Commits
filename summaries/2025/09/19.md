# Activity Summary for 19/09/2025

## 10:02:16
The log shows multiple updates to components of a document configuration system, spanning both the front-end (Vue.js components) and back-end (Node.js API services).

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/app.js` file, updated at `19/09/2025, 09:18:56`, is the main application file for the API.  It uses Express.js with numerous middleware for security (helmet, cors, xss, compression),  request body handling, and authentication (passport.js with JWT strategy).  Crucially, it sets up BullMQ for background jobs related to attendance, bulk user uploads, and leave balances.  Error handling middleware is also defined.  Scheduled jobs (`scheduleUserChecks`, `updateOrgChart`, `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder`) are initiated at startup.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` file undergoes multiple revisions between `19/09/2025, 09:27:00` and `19/09/2025, 09:42:36`. These changes center around refining the UI for managing document types.  The component uses Vuetify for its UI framework.  Significant changes include improved handling of email templates for expiry reminders, including adding a dialog for creating/editing templates and enhancing error handling and validation.  The most substantial changes are in the email template management section, adding features like a preview, available placeholders, and loading states.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` file is updated twice, at `19/09/2025, 09:42:30` and `19/09/2025, 10:00:41`. This file appears to be the main view component for the document configuration section. Updates here involve adding filtering and sorting capabilities to the document list and improving error handling in the `handleSubmit` method. The error handling now includes validation checks to ensure all required fields are filled before submitting data.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` file is also revised multiple times, between `19/09/2025, 09:54:09` and `19/09/2025, 09:55:33`.  This file contains the backend logic for handling document configurations.  The changes focus on the `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function, which is simplified by removing some console logs and minor adjustments to the error handling.  The core functionality of sending notifications and emails remains the same, sending notifications to both the user and their manager.


In summary, the code changes reflect an iterative refinement process focused on improving both the user interface for configuring document types and enhancing the robustness of the backend API. A key theme is the addition of features related to email-based expiry reminders, including creation and management of templates and a detailed process for sending notifications. The improvements suggest a focus on user experience and data integrity.


## 11:02:17
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js`.

**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue`:** This file, a Vue.js component, underwent two significant changes.  The first at `19/09/2025, 10:34:07` introduced a UI for managing document configurations, including basic details (type, applicability, category, description) and settings (required, expiry, expiry reminders, supported file types, maximum file size, image ratio). The second change at `19/09/2025, 10:58:54` appears to be a minor update, as the code is largely identical to the previous version;  no functional changes are readily apparent.


**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js`:**  This file, containing backend services for document configuration, shows a series of edits focused on the `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function.

Initially (`19/09/2025, 10:35:38`), this function sent email notifications and database notifications for document expiry reminders, including handling cases with and without reporting managers.  The function was then modified several times (`19/09/2025, 10:53:08`, `19/09/2025, 10:53:26`, `19/09/2025, 10:56:27`, `19/09/2025, 11:00:04`, `19/09/2025, 11:00:19`, `19/09/2025, 11:00:37`) between `10:53:08` and `11:00:37`.  These revisions primarily involved adding extensive logging statements to track the notification process, making the code easier to debug.  There were also minor adjustments to error handling and the way email templates were handled. The changes between `10:54:09` and `10:54:37` were empty commits, suggesting potential interruptions or abandoned changes. The final version reverted back to a previous version, removing added logging and email sending to user and instead, reverting to a previous version that only sent notification to reporting managers and the user.  The core functionality of sending notifications and emails remained consistent across most versions.  The changes between `10:35:38` and `10:56:27` are significant, showing the addition of email sending to both the user and the user's reporting manager. The code is largely consistent between `10:56:27` and `11:00:37`, indicating finalization of the improved notification system.


## 12:07:00
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` between 11:03:41 and 11:42:48 on 19/09/2025.  The main changes center around improving the email template editor dialog.  Specifically, the most significant change was the addition of a `populatedPlaceholders` computed property at 11:04:46, which dynamically populates placeholder values in the email template editor with sample data from the application's state (user, company, documentType).  This improves the preview functionality.  A minor change at 11:03:57 corrected the `item-value` property in the email template selection to `"id"` from `"_id"`.  The final revision at 11:42:48 made minor styling adjustments to the preview section within the email template dialog.


The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/routes/documentConfig.route.js` file was updated twice, at 11:09:38 and 11:12:56 on the same day. The key change was the addition of the `verifyToken` middleware to all routes at 11:12:56, presumably to implement authentication and authorization for document configuration endpoints.


The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` file was updated twice, at 11:21:16 and 11:37:27.  The changes primarily focused on improving error handling and user feedback within the `handleSubmit` method.  Specifically, a check was added to prevent submission if no changes are detected (11:36:19), and minor improvements were made to the success and error messages. A redundant `loading` variable was removed from the data section (11:37:27).  The overall structure and functionality of the document configuration interface remained consistent across revisions.


## 13:06:54
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` on September 19th, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and refinements, with no significant structural alterations to the component.  The timestamps indicate a period of active development between 12:09 PM and 12:33 PM.  The component is a Vue.js component for managing document configurations, including basic details and settings such as expiry reminders. The component uses  `v-tabs` for navigation between "Basic Details" and "Settings" sections. The "Settings" section prominently features functionality for managing email templates for expiry reminders, including creating, editing, and refreshing templates.  There's also configuration for supported file types (images or documents), maximum file size, and image ratio (if image type is selected).  The code consistently uses Vuetify components (`v-text-field`, `v-combobox`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-switch`, `v-dialog`, etc.) and Vuex getters (`getCompany`, `getUser`) for data access.  The lack of substantial code changes between timestamps suggests debugging or minor UI improvements rather than major feature additions or refactoring.
