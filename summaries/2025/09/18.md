# Activity Summary for 18/09/2025

## 12:09:42
The codebase primarily manages document configuration and birthday notifications.  The `documentConfig.service.js` file underwent several revisions on September 18th, 2025, between 11:43:04 and 11:48:01.  These changes focused on refining the `updateDocumentConfig` and `partialUpdateDocumentConfig` functions.  Initially, these functions did not always trigger email notifications upon updates; later versions included conditional checks to send notifications if `hasExpiryReminder` and `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` were set.  The `createDocumentConfig` function was also modified at 11:48:01 to send notifications immediately after creation if the relevant conditions were met.  The core functionality of the service, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting document configurations remained consistent, with the key change being the addition of more robust notification triggers.

The `birthday.js` file, updated at 12:07:50 on September 18th, 2025, contains two functions: `funBirthday` and `sendBirthdayNotification`.  `funBirthday` sends birthday emails to active users based on a cron expression. It retrieves user data, checks if the current date matches the user's birthday, and then sends a personalized birthday email using AWS SES. `sendBirthdayNotification` sends birthday notifications to all employees the day before an employee's birthday using a different email template. Both functions utilize MongoDB aggregation for efficient data retrieval and leverage email templates from the `Configuration` model.  The AWS SES configuration is present but appears incomplete (missing accessKeyId and secretAccessKey).


## 13:09:44
The codebase shows updates to cron job functionalities within an HRMS system.  Significant changes occurred around 12:09:02 PM on September 18, 2025, with the addition of a new `document_expiry.js` file and subsequent modifications to other files around the same time.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/routes/cron_jobs.route.js` (12:21:28 PM): This file defines Express.js routes for managing various cron jobs, including those for reporting (monthly, client, assets), probation completion, birthdays, work anniversaries, attendance, leave updates, and notifications (leave reminders, conflicts, irregular attendance, loan repayments, WFH, business trips, expense claims).  It appears to be a central point of configuration and execution for many scheduled tasks within the application.  The file was updated to include many additional cron jobs.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` (12:47:47 PM): This service handles document configuration, focusing on expiry reminders.  It includes functions for creating, updating, retrieving, deleting, and sending notifications about document expiry.  The service uses a normalization function (`normalizeConfig`) for data consistency and sends both email and in-app notifications to employees and their managers.

`/response_e64523de-e180-44e6-bd21-cd746f8788d2/0` (multiple timestamps, 13:05:36 PM, 13:07:02 PM, 13:08:07 PM): This file (likely a dynamically generated path), contains the implementation for the document expiry cron job.  There are multiple versions present in the log, suggesting iterative development and refinement of the cron job's logic. The core functionality involves retrieving documents nearing expiry, determining appropriate reminder days based on configuration, and sending notifications using the `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` service.  The multiple timestamps here indicate revisions in the document expiry notification logic; however, the content remained largely the same in the three instances.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/cron-jobs/document_expiry.js` (13:09:02 PM): This file contains two functions, `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` and `notifyExpiredDocuments`.  `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` closely mirrors the logic in `/response_e64523de-e180-44e6-bd21-cd746f8788d2/0`, suggesting a refactoring effort or a move to a more structured approach.  `notifyExpiredDocuments` is a legacy function that uses different notification logic.   This new file directly implements the document expiry cron job, separating it from the routes and services.  This function uses an aggregate query for users with active documents. Then it iterates through the documents, checks expiry dates, calculates days to expiry, and sends email notifications to the employee, manager, and HR manager based on document type and time-to-expiry.

In summary, the log shows the implementation and refinement of a new feature for sending document expiry reminders, demonstrating a common pattern of iterative development and code organization typical in software projects.  The feature includes email and in-app notifications to users and their managers, showing a holistic approach to notifications.  There is evidence of a shift from a legacy notification system to a more streamlined approach.


## 15:09:52
The log shows iterative development of a document expiry notification system.  The primary focus is on `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/cron-jobs/document_expiry.js`, which contains two cron jobs: `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` and `notifyExpiredDocuments`.

Initially (13:23:28), `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` used the `Document` model. This was updated (14:02:18, 14:05:06, 14:10:30) to use the `Documents` model, along with significant changes in how documents are queried and notifications are sent.  Improvements included handling of deleted documents (`is_deleted: false`), using `expiry` field instead of `expiry_date`, adding more robust error handling, and improving user identification using `foreign_id` or `created_by`. The `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function also received additional parameters for improved context.  Between 14:02:18 and 14:05:06, no functional change occurred; only formatting differences are apparent.

Further updates at 14:42:36 addressed handling both string and ObjectId types for `document.type` in config lookups. At 15:02:47, the config lookup was simplified to compare using the `_id` directly.  A debugging log was added at 15:09:14 to assist in identifying discrepancies between document types and their corresponding configurations.

The legacy function `notifyExpiredDocuments` remained largely untouched throughout the process, indicating a possible strategy for maintaining backward compatibility.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/app.js` file shows the integration of these cron jobs into the application.  Initially (14:27:34), `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` was scheduled, but the scheduling expression was changed multiple times (14:29:57, 14:34:45) and ultimately settled on `*/2 * * * *` (every 2 minutes), which likely reflects a testing phase.  Other cron jobs, `scheduleUserChecks` and `updateOrgChart`, are also managed here.

The files starting with `/response_` appear to be temporary files or intermediate states during the development process.  These files show the evolution of `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` before the final version was committed to the main source code.


## 16:09:41
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/cron-jobs/document_expiry.js` on September 18th, 2025.  The file contains two main functions: `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` and `notifyExpiredDocuments`. Both functions manage document expiry notifications via email.


The first significant change (15:10:07) involves a complete implementation of both functions.  `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` sends reminders based on configurations stored in `DocumentConfig` and document data from `Documents`. `notifyExpiredDocuments` directly checks user document expiry dates (passport, visa, emirates ID, labour card) and sends notifications to employees, HR, and managers based on pre-defined thresholds.


A second revision (15:57:21) modifies the `Documents` model import path from `../models/documents.model` to `../models/document_types.model`, suggesting a renaming or restructuring of the document model.  The rest of the code remains functionally identical.

The final revision (16:04:14) changes the way document type matching is handled in `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder`. The previous comparison of `c._id.toString() === document.type` is replaced with a case-insensitive comparison `c.label.toLowerCase() === document.type.toLowerCase()`. This change improves the robustness of the matching process by handling variations in capitalization.  Additionally,  an email to the employee was missing in the previous version and was added in this version.

Overall, the changes demonstrate iterative improvements to a document expiry notification system. The focus is on refining the logic for matching document types, and ensuring that all necessary email notifications are sent.


## 17:10:43
The log shows three revisions of the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/app.js` file on September 18th, 2025.  The changes are minor and primarily focused on the `cron-jobs` directory and do not affect core functionality.

The first revision (16:24:33) establishes the base version of the code.  Subsequent changes are incremental.

The second revision (16:41:06) contains no functional changes; the code is identical to the first revision.

The third revision (16:44:06) involves a single, small change: the path to the `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` function is updated from `./cron-jobs/expiredDocumentsReminder` to `./cron-jobs/document_expiry`.  This suggests a refactoring of the cron job related to document expiry, possibly moving it to a more appropriately named file or directory.  The rest of the code remains unchanged across all three revisions.  The code consistently uses Express.js for creating the server, incorporates various middleware for security (helmet, xss, compression, cors), and utilizes queues (attendanceQueue, bulkUserUploadQueue, leaveBalancesQueue) managed by BullMQ.  Scheduled jobs for user checks, organizational chart updates, and expired document reminders are also present.


## 20:09:48
The log shows modifications to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/cron-jobs/document_expiry.js`.  The file contains two main functions: `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` and `notifyExpiredDocuments`.

The `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` function is extensively modified throughout the log.  Initially (19:16:55 and 19:17:29), it uses `Documents.find().populate()` to retrieve document expiry data. However, later revisions (starting 19:25:51) remove the `.populate()` call due to reported issues, opting instead to fetch document types manually from `DocumentTypes.find()` and create a `documentTypesMap`.  This change significantly improves efficiency by performing a single query for all document types rather than querying for each document individually.

Subsequent commits further enhance the document type-to-configuration matching logic. A hardcoded `typeToConfigMapping` object is introduced (19:30:56) to handle cases where the document type name doesn't directly match the configuration label. This mapping is improved in later revisions to handle case-insensitive matching and normalization of document type names (19:36:28, 19:37:09, 19:37:20, 19:37:30).  The final version (19:59:53) implements a more robust dynamic matching strategy that utilizes exact match, partial match, and even fuzzy matching based on cleaned document type and configuration labels. This greatly increases flexibility in matching, aiming for a more accurate configuration lookup.

The improvements include added logging throughout the function (especially between 19:25:51 and 19:37:30) to provide enhanced debugging and monitoring capabilities. This logging includes additional information about the matching process, document expiry dates, and reminders.  The `notifyExpiredDocuments` function shows no significant changes throughout the log, indicating that the focus of development is primarily on improving the document reminder functionality.

Significant changes happened between 19:25:51 and 19:59:53, focusing on improving the reliability and accuracy of the document type-config matching process.  The final commit introduced a sophisticated three-tiered matching system (exact, partial, fuzzy) to mitigate the mismatches occurring in earlier versions. The inclusion of extensive logging helps identify potential issues and ensures more robust operation.


## 21:33:22
The code consists of two main cron jobs: `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` and `notifyExpiredDocuments`.  Both utilize the `node-cron` library for scheduling.

`notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` (Timestamp: 18/09/2025, 20:11:22): This function checks for documents nearing expiry based on configured reminder days defined in `DocumentConfig` model.  It iterates through active document configurations and matching documents, sending email reminders using `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` service before the actual expiry date.  The user details for notification are retrieved using the `foreign_id` or `created_by` field from the `Documents` model.  Error handling is included for missing configurations, invalid expiry dates, and notification failures.

`notifyExpiredDocuments`: This function identifies users with expiring documents ('passport', 'visa', 'emirates id', 'labour card') based on predefined intervals (6.5, 4, 2.5, 1.5, and 90 days before expiry for different document types). It then sends email notifications to employees and their respective reporting managers (if applicable) using email templates retrieved from a `Configuration` model.  The notification targets are determined by flags within the expiringDocs array (`notifyEmployee`, `notifyHR`, `notifyManager`).  The email content is dynamically generated based on the expiring documents and user/company data retrieved from multiple models (`User`, `Companies`, `Role`).


Both functions extensively use Mongoose for database interactions, Moment.js for date manipulation, and a custom `sendEmail` function for email delivery. The code exhibits a pattern of retrieving data from multiple collections (`User`, `Documents`, `Configuration`, `Companies`, `Role`) and uses asynchronous operations extensively.  There's also some hardcoded logic in the `notifyExpiredDocuments` function concerning notification intervals for different document types, suggesting potential areas for refactoring to allow for greater configurability.
