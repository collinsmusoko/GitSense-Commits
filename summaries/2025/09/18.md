# Activity Summary for 18/09/2025

## 12:09:42
The codebase primarily manages document configuration and birthday notifications.  The `documentConfig.service.js` file underwent several revisions on September 18th, 2025, between 11:43:04 and 11:48:01.  These changes focused on refining the `updateDocumentConfig` and `partialUpdateDocumentConfig` functions.  Initially, these functions did not always trigger email notifications upon updates; later versions included conditional checks to send notifications if `hasExpiryReminder` and `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` were set.  The `createDocumentConfig` function was also modified at 11:48:01 to send notifications immediately after creation if the relevant conditions were met.  The core functionality of the service, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting document configurations remained consistent, with the key change being the addition of more robust notification triggers.

The `birthday.js` file, updated at 12:07:50 on September 18th, 2025, contains two functions: `funBirthday` and `sendBirthdayNotification`.  `funBirthday` sends birthday emails to active users based on a cron expression. It retrieves user data, checks if the current date matches the user's birthday, and then sends a personalized birthday email using AWS SES. `sendBirthdayNotification` sends birthday notifications to all employees the day before an employee's birthday using a different email template. Both functions utilize MongoDB aggregation for efficient data retrieval and leverage email templates from the `Configuration` model.  The AWS SES configuration is present but appears incomplete (missing accessKeyId and secretAccessKey).


## 13:09:44
The codebase shows updates to cron job functionalities within an HRMS system.  Significant changes occurred around 12:09:02 PM on September 18, 2025, with the addition of a new `document_expiry.js` file and subsequent modifications to other files around the same time.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/routes/cron_jobs.route.js` (12:21:28 PM): This file defines Express.js routes for managing various cron jobs, including those for reporting (monthly, client, assets), probation completion, birthdays, work anniversaries, attendance, leave updates, and notifications (leave reminders, conflicts, irregular attendance, loan repayments, WFH, business trips, expense claims).  It appears to be a central point of configuration and execution for many scheduled tasks within the application.  The file was updated to include many additional cron jobs.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` (12:47:47 PM): This service handles document configuration, focusing on expiry reminders.  It includes functions for creating, updating, retrieving, deleting, and sending notifications about document expiry.  The service uses a normalization function (`normalizeConfig`) for data consistency and sends both email and in-app notifications to employees and their managers.

`/response_e64523de-e180-44e6-bd21-cd746f8788d2/0` (multiple timestamps, 13:05:36 PM, 13:07:02 PM, 13:08:07 PM): This file (likely a dynamically generated path), contains the implementation for the document expiry cron job.  There are multiple versions present in the log, suggesting iterative development and refinement of the cron job's logic. The core functionality involves retrieving documents nearing expiry, determining appropriate reminder days based on configuration, and sending notifications using the `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` service.  The multiple timestamps here indicate revisions in the document expiry notification logic; however, the content remained largely the same in the three instances.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/cron-jobs/document_expiry.js` (13:09:02 PM): This file contains two functions, `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` and `notifyExpiredDocuments`.  `notifyExpiredDocumentsReminder` closely mirrors the logic in `/response_e64523de-e180-44e6-bd21-cd746f8788d2/0`, suggesting a refactoring effort or a move to a more structured approach.  `notifyExpiredDocuments` is a legacy function that uses different notification logic.   This new file directly implements the document expiry cron job, separating it from the routes and services.  This function uses an aggregate query for users with active documents. Then it iterates through the documents, checks expiry dates, calculates days to expiry, and sends email notifications to the employee, manager, and HR manager based on document type and time-to-expiry.

In summary, the log shows the implementation and refinement of a new feature for sending document expiry reminders, demonstrating a common pattern of iterative development and code organization typical in software projects.  The feature includes email and in-app notifications to users and their managers, showing a holistic approach to notifications.  There is evidence of a shift from a legacy notification system to a more streamlined approach.
