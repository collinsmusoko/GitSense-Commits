# Activity Summary for 18/09/2025

## 12:09:42
The codebase primarily manages document configuration and birthday notifications.  The `documentConfig.service.js` file underwent several revisions on September 18th, 2025, between 11:43:04 and 11:48:01.  These changes focused on refining the `updateDocumentConfig` and `partialUpdateDocumentConfig` functions.  Initially, these functions did not always trigger email notifications upon updates; later versions included conditional checks to send notifications if `hasExpiryReminder` and `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` were set.  The `createDocumentConfig` function was also modified at 11:48:01 to send notifications immediately after creation if the relevant conditions were met.  The core functionality of the service, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting document configurations remained consistent, with the key change being the addition of more robust notification triggers.

The `birthday.js` file, updated at 12:07:50 on September 18th, 2025, contains two functions: `funBirthday` and `sendBirthdayNotification`.  `funBirthday` sends birthday emails to active users based on a cron expression. It retrieves user data, checks if the current date matches the user's birthday, and then sends a personalized birthday email using AWS SES. `sendBirthdayNotification` sends birthday notifications to all employees the day before an employee's birthday using a different email template. Both functions utilize MongoDB aggregation for efficient data retrieval and leverage email templates from the `Configuration` model.  The AWS SES configuration is present but appears incomplete (missing accessKeyId and secretAccessKey).
