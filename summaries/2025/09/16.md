# Activity Summary for 16/09/2025

## 14:25:58
The log shows a series of edits to the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` files between 14:12 and 14:24 on September 16, 2025, and to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/document-card.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/details/documents.vue` files.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the functionality for managing document types and their associated settings within an HRMS system.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` underwent multiple revisions.  The most significant change involved the addition of email template management functionality (around 14:13:25). This includes features for adding, editing, saving, and viewing email templates associated with document expiry reminders.  The `expiryReminders` data structure changed from using `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` (an array or a number) to `expiryReminders` (an array of objects with `days`, `templateId`, and `templateName` fields).  A migration logic was added to `index.vue` to handle the existing data structure.


`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` was also updated multiple times.  The main change was the addition of data migration logic to handle the previous structure of the `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` field within the `documentType` object. The updates are consistent with changes in `fields.vue`, ensuring compatibility with the newly added email template functionality. The file also handles the saving and fetching of document types, including input validation.  The `handleSubmit` method ensures that all required fields are filled before saving a new or updated document type.


`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/document-card.vue` shows the implementation of a document card component that displays document details, including upload, expiry date management, and active/deleted status.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/details/documents.vue` displays a list of company documents using the `DocumentCard` component in a view-only mode (`action="view"`).


In summary, the code changes reflect a significant enhancement to the document management system, specifically adding email template management capabilities and improved handling of document expiry.  The iterative nature of the commits suggests a phased development approach, with the email template feature being added incrementally.  There is also evidence of backwards compatibility being implemented to handle previous data structures.


## 15:25:58
The log shows multiple revisions to the front-end components (`*.vue` files) and the back-end service (`documentConfig.service.js`) for managing document configurations within an HRMS system.

**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` (16/09/2025, 14:32:54):** This Vue component handles the form for creating and editing individual document types.  It uses Vuetify components for a form with tabs ("Basic Details" and "Settings"), allowing configuration of document type, applicability, category, description, required status, expiry settings, and supported file types (images or documents) with size limits and image ratio.  The component includes methods for adding and removing expiry reminders and image preview.

**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` (Multiple Revisions):** This is the main Vue component for the document configuration section.  It shows a list of document configurations, allowing filtering by "Company Documents" or "Employee Documents", sorting, searching, creating new configurations, and editing existing ones. A dialog is used to display the `fields.vue` component for detailed editing. Significant changes occurred between 14:33:08 and 14:51:50.  These changes primarily involved adding functionality for handling document expiry reminders. The final revision (14:51:50) includes logging of the notification data sent for expiry reminders and improved success message to include confirmation of expiry reminder notification configuration.  The component also integrates with Vuex for data fetching and state management, and utilizes other custom components like `AddBtn`, `Search`, and `CloseBtn`.  Importantly, the component now uses `mapGetters` from Vuex to access `user` and `company` data, enabling the inclusion of user and company IDs in the notification payload.


**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` (Multiple Revisions):** This file contains the back-end logic for managing document configurations.  The initial version provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.  Subsequent revisions (starting at 15:14:37) add a crucial `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function. This function sends notifications to users (and their managers, if applicable) about document expiry reminders. It uses `NotificationHelper` to save notifications to a database and `sendNotification` for real-time notifications.  The `createDocumentConfig` and `updateDocumentConfig` functions were updated to call `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` when appropriate (i.e., when `hasExpiryReminder` is true and `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` has values). The updates show the addition of a robust notification system for document expiry reminders.  These changes involved integrating with a `User` model, `NotificationHelper`, and a notification sending function, likely using environment variables (`process.env.NOTIFICATION_DB_PRODUCT_ID`) for notification service IDs. The service ensures that `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` is always an array, regardless of input format.

**Overall Pattern:** The changes reflect a significant enhancement focused on implementing a notification system for document expiry reminders. This involved adding functionality in both the front-end and back-end to manage and send notifications, including to the user's reporting manager. The timestamps indicate focused development within a short time frame.  The use of Vuex in the front-end and a well-structured service layer on the back-end suggests a well-organized application architecture.


## 17:26:06
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` between 16:00:21 and 17:23:53 on September 16, 2025.

**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` Updates:**

The `index.vue` file underwent several iterations primarily focused on managing document expiry reminders.  Initially,  `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` was a simple array.  Later revisions introduced a data migration to convert this to a more complex structure, `expiryReminders`, which includes `days`, `templateId`, and `templateName` properties.  The `handleSubmit` method was modified to handle this new structure, sending both `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` (for backward compatibility) and `emailTemplates` in the payload to the API.  The changes were made incrementally, with several intermediate commits showing different stages of the migration.  The final version uses `expiryReminders` consistently and removes the `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` property completely from the `documentType` object.

**`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` Updates:**

The `documentConfig.service.js` file saw concurrent changes reflecting the frontend's `expiryReminders` migration.  The service initially only processed a simple array for `daysBeforeExpiryReminder`, but was later updated to handle the more complex object structure which includes template information, while still maintaining backwards compatibility for the older format.  The `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function was significantly enhanced to include more detailed logging, improved error handling (using more descriptive error messages and logging stack traces), and added email functionality for both the user and their reporting manager (if one exists).  These changes occurred in a series of rapid updates between 16:36:55 and 17:10:19.  The logging within `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` became much more verbose, providing more context for debugging.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

- The primary focus across all changes is the implementation and improvement of document expiry reminders and notification system.  This involved changes in both the frontend and backend code.
- The code consistently handles both creation (`$post`) and update (`$put`) operations for document configurations.
- Error handling is consistently implemented using `try...catch...finally` blocks in both files.
- Extensive use of console logging for debugging purposes.
- A significant pattern is the iterative refinement of the data structure for expiry reminders, showcasing a staged migration approach.
