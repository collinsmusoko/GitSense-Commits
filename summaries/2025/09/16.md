# Activity Summary for 16/09/2025

## 14:25:58
The log shows a series of edits to the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` files between 14:12 and 14:24 on September 16, 2025, and to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/document-card.vue` and `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/details/documents.vue` files.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the functionality for managing document types and their associated settings within an HRMS system.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` underwent multiple revisions.  The most significant change involved the addition of email template management functionality (around 14:13:25). This includes features for adding, editing, saving, and viewing email templates associated with document expiry reminders.  The `expiryReminders` data structure changed from using `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` (an array or a number) to `expiryReminders` (an array of objects with `days`, `templateId`, and `templateName` fields).  A migration logic was added to `index.vue` to handle the existing data structure.


`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` was also updated multiple times.  The main change was the addition of data migration logic to handle the previous structure of the `daysBeforeExpiryReminder` field within the `documentType` object. The updates are consistent with changes in `fields.vue`, ensuring compatibility with the newly added email template functionality. The file also handles the saving and fetching of document types, including input validation.  The `handleSubmit` method ensures that all required fields are filled before saving a new or updated document type.


`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/document-card.vue` shows the implementation of a document card component that displays document details, including upload, expiry date management, and active/deleted status.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/details/documents.vue` displays a list of company documents using the `DocumentCard` component in a view-only mode (`action="view"`).


In summary, the code changes reflect a significant enhancement to the document management system, specifically adding email template management capabilities and improved handling of document expiry.  The iterative nature of the commits suggests a phased development approach, with the email template feature being added incrementally.  There is also evidence of backwards compatibility being implemented to handle previous data structures.
