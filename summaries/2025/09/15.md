# Activity Summary for 15/09/2025

## 13:17:02
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue`, both on September 15, 2025.  The primary difference between the two revisions is a minor change in the title within the component's template.  The initial revision had "Documents Configuratorsssssss" while the second revision corrected it to "Documents Configurator".  The code itself remained largely unchanged, indicating a simple typo correction. Both revisions feature a Vue.js component responsible for managing document configurations, including search, filtering, sorting, creating, and updating document types.  The component interacts with a backend API (`/document-config`) using `$axios` for data fetching and saving.  Error handling and user feedback mechanisms using a Vuex store (`this.$store.commit("setSnackbar")`) are also implemented.  The component uses several sub-components for reusability (Search, AddBtn, Fields, List).  The timestamp of the second revision (12:47:40) is only 36 seconds after the first (12:47:04), implying a quick fix.


## 14:17:03
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` on September 15th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the handling of expiry reminders for documents.

Initially (13:59:53), the component included a single text field for `documentType.daysBeforeExpiryReminder`.

Subsequent revisions (14:00:02 and 14:00:20) significantly altered the expiry reminder section.  A single text field was replaced with a more dynamic interface.  The changes introduced:

* **Multiple Reminders:** The component now allows for multiple expiry reminder days, each with its own text field, enabling the user to add or remove reminders.
* **Add/Remove Functionality:**  `addReminder` and `removeReminder` methods were added to manage the array of reminder days (`documentType.daysBeforeExpiryReminder`).
* **Improved UI:** The UI was improved to better present multiple reminder days, incorporating buttons to add and remove entries and more descriptive labels.
* **Enhanced Validation:** Validation rules were tightened to ensure that reminder days are not only present but also greater than zero.


The final version (14:09:18) shows no further changes to the core functionality, indicating that the changes related to expiry reminders were finalized by this timestamp.  Throughout all revisions, the rest of the component (basic document details, supported file types, and image handling) remained consistent.
