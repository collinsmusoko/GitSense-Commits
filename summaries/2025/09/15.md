# Activity Summary for 15/09/2025

## 13:17:02
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue`, both on September 15, 2025.  The primary difference between the two revisions is a minor change in the title within the component's template.  The initial revision had "Documents Configuratorsssssss" while the second revision corrected it to "Documents Configurator".  The code itself remained largely unchanged, indicating a simple typo correction. Both revisions feature a Vue.js component responsible for managing document configurations, including search, filtering, sorting, creating, and updating document types.  The component interacts with a backend API (`/document-config`) using `$axios` for data fetching and saving.  Error handling and user feedback mechanisms using a Vuex store (`this.$store.commit("setSnackbar")`) are also implemented.  The component uses several sub-components for reusability (Search, AddBtn, Fields, List).  The timestamp of the second revision (12:47:40) is only 36 seconds after the first (12:47:04), implying a quick fix.
