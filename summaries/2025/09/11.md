# Activity Summary for 11/09/2025

## 11:38:11
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/companies/document-card.vue` on November 9th, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be refinements to the UI component responsible for displaying and managing document cards.  No significant functional changes are evident across these revisions.

The most notable change is a small correction in the `v-icon` within the `v-card-title` at approximately 11:24:40. The class condition for the `transform-180` was changed from `isOpened` to `!isOpened`, suggesting a fix related to the chevron down icon's rotation behavior.  The other changes made between 11:14:50 and 11:27:09 seem to be minor formatting adjustments or very subtle code restructuring that do not alter the component's functionality. The code itself is a Vue.js component dealing with file uploads, display, deletion, and expiry management.  It uses features like `v-expand-transition`, `v-dialog`, and Vuetify components for a user-friendly interface.  The component handles different file types (images and PDFs), file size validation, expiry date handling, and active/inactive file status.  The code consistently shows a pattern of robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
