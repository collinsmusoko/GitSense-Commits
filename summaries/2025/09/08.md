# Activity Summary for 08/09/2025

## 10:07:38
The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/utils/letter.js` file was updated on 08/09/2025 at 09:59:47.  The update focuses on enhancing letter generation functionality.  Key changes include:

* **Improved letter field handling:** The `stringifyLetterFields` function was significantly revised to handle both array and object formats for `request.letterFields`, ensuring consistent processing of letter fields regardless of their structure.  It now correctly handles nested objects and adds brackets to keys where necessary.  Additional logging statements were added throughout this function for debugging purposes.

* **Enhanced company details retrieval:** The `getCompanyDetails` function was improved to handle different data structures for the `companies` parameter, returning the appropriate company details.

* **Added letter preview generation:** The `generateLetterPreview` function was implemented, which takes context including user data, company data, and a letter template, to generate a letter preview. This function uses the updated field handling and company details retrieval functions, sends a request to a backend service (`process.env.documenturl`), and returns the generated letter (PDF or otherwise).  The function includes error handling and uses placeholder image URLs for signatures and logos.

* **Helper functions for user data and letter formatting:** Several helper functions (`getUserTitle`, `getUserName`, `getDayName`, `getVerbReason`, `getCompanyOrHimHer`, `findKey`, `replaceLetterFields`) were added or modified to support the letter generation process. These functions handle tasks like determining user titles, formatting names and dates, and retrieving specific values from the letter fields.


The code uses Lodash (`_`) and `number-to-words` libraries.  The frequent use of bracketed keys (`[...]`) suggests a templating system where these keys are replaced with actual values during letter generation.  The code makes an API call to a document generation service at an address specified in an environment variable (`process.env.documenturl`).  The use of placeholder image URLs suggests the system is under development or using generic placeholder images.
