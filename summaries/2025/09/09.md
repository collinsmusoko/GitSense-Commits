# Activity Summary for 09/09/2025

## 09:33:27
The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/utils/letter.js` file underwent several modifications on September 9th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be enhancing the `stringifyLetterFields` function within the `generateLetterPreview` function.

The first two revisions (09:24:00 and 09:25:56) involved adding logging statements to the `stringifyLetterFields` function.  Specifically, a `console.log` statement was introduced to track the matching of fields and whether a value was found (exact match, clean match, or direct value). This suggests debugging efforts aimed at improving the accuracy of field value retrieval.

The final revision (09:26:59) added further logging to display all fields and their corresponding values processed by `stringifyLetterFields` before the mapping process. This change provides more comprehensive logging for debugging purposes, showing the input data to the function.  No structural changes to the functions are apparent across these edits; only logging additions occurred.  The timestamps indicate that these changes were made in quick succession, likely part of an iterative debugging process. The core functionality of the file—generating letter previews—remains unchanged.
