# Activity Summary for 12/09/2025

## 04:17:43
The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/utils/letter.js` file was updated on 11/09/2025 at 18:07:13.  The update focuses on enhancing letter generation functionality.  Key changes include:

* **Improved letter field handling:** The `stringifyLetterFields` and `replaceLetterFields` functions were significantly revised to handle various data structures (arrays, objects) within the `letterFields` property, ensuring correct key-value pair extraction and formatting for letter templates.  The functions now properly handle both flat and nested objects, and account for different key formats ([key] vs. key).


* **Enhanced company details retrieval:** The `getCompanyDetails` function was modified to handle different data types for the `companies` parameter, robustly extracting company information regardless of whether it's an object or an array.


* **Conditional logic for letter preview generation:** The `generateLetterPreview` function incorporates conditional logic based on letter status (`completed` or `approved`), dynamically including official stamps and manager signatures in the preview based on approval status.  It also uses conditional logic to determine if a PDF download or content replacement is needed and makes appropriate API calls.


* **API interaction for letter preview:** The function sends a payload to a document generation API (`process.env.documenturl` is used but its content is not shown) to generate either a PDF preview or a content replacement, managing responses and error handling.


* **Helper functions for name, date, and verb formatting:**  Several helper functions (`getUserName`, `getDayName`, `getVerbReason`, `getCompanyOrHimHer`, `getUserTitle`) were added to improve code modularity and readability, handling tasks such as formatting user names, dates and generating personalized letter content.


The code heavily utilizes `lodash` and `number-to-words` libraries. There's a pattern of using bracket notation (`[key]`) for field keys throughout the code. The update significantly improves the robustness and flexibility of the letter generation process.
