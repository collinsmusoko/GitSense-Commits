# Activity Summary for 03/09/2025

## 10:30:32
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/reuseable/letter/index.vue` on March 9th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be refining the user interface for a letter request form.

The earliest revisions (09:46:33, 09:51:16, 09:56:32, 09:57:21) involve minor adjustments to styling and structure, primarily focusing on the display of text fields within the `v-col` elements.  Specifically, the class `grey-heading-text font-weight-medium textFontSize mr-1` is added and removed from the v-col and the text size in `v-text-field` is changed from display-1 to text-sm. These changes are iterative and likely focused on improving visual presentation.


A more significant change occurs between 09:57:21 and 10:15:54.  The `letterFields` computed property's filter method is modified to exclude a field with the key 'bank'. This was then undone  in the following revisions (10:18:01 and 10:19:36).  The  `field.i` in the filter condition was replaced with `field.key` correcting a potential error.  The final revision at 10:29:32 finalizes this correction and removes the "Bank" field from within the `v-for` loop,  instead adding it as a separate `v-text-field` outside the loop. This implies a decision to treat the 'Bank' field differently, possibly due to its unique nature or layout requirements.  The other changes during this period are minor styling adjustments.  There are no changes in the underlying functionality of the form submission or data handling.  The consistent use of `@blur="$emit('reload')` across many input elements suggests a design pattern for real-time updates or validation.
