# Activity Summary for 10/09/2025

## 09:16:17
The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/utils/letter.js` file was updated on 10/09/2025 at 08:57:32.  The update involved modifications to functions related to letter generation.

Key changes include:

* **Improved  `getCompanyDetails` function:** This function now handles different data structures for `companies`, correctly returning company details even if `companies` is an object instead of an array.

* **Enhanced letter field processing:** The `stringifyLetterFields` and `replaceLetterFields` functions were significantly updated to handle various data structures for `request.letterFields` (arrays and objects). They now consistently format keys with brackets (`[...]`) and improve the logic to find and replace letter fields, including handling nested objects and direct values.

* **Added error handling:** The `generateLetterPreview` function now includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during letter generation and API calls.


The code heavily uses helper functions to extract and format user data, company details, and letter fields.  The `generateLetterPreview` function is the main function responsible for generating letter previews, making API calls to `/api/DocumentEditor/ReplaceContent` or `/api/DocumentEditor/ReplaceContentToPDF` endpoint based on whether a PDF download is requested, and including signatures from URLs. The functions consistently use bracket notation (`[...]`) for keys within the letter templates.  There's a reliance on external APIs (indicated by `${process.env.documenturl}`) for document generation and processing.
