# Activity Summary for 10/09/2025

## 09:16:17
The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/utils/letter.js` file was updated on 10/09/2025 at 08:57:32.  The update involved modifications to functions related to letter generation.

Key changes include:

* **Improved  `getCompanyDetails` function:** This function now handles different data structures for `companies`, correctly returning company details even if `companies` is an object instead of an array.

* **Enhanced letter field processing:** The `stringifyLetterFields` and `replaceLetterFields` functions were significantly updated to handle various data structures for `request.letterFields` (arrays and objects). They now consistently format keys with brackets (`[...]`) and improve the logic to find and replace letter fields, including handling nested objects and direct values.

* **Added error handling:** The `generateLetterPreview` function now includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during letter generation and API calls.


The code heavily uses helper functions to extract and format user data, company details, and letter fields.  The `generateLetterPreview` function is the main function responsible for generating letter previews, making API calls to `/api/DocumentEditor/ReplaceContent` or `/api/DocumentEditor/ReplaceContentToPDF` endpoint based on whether a PDF download is requested, and including signatures from URLs. The functions consistently use bracket notation (`[...]`) for keys within the letter templates.  There's a reliance on external APIs (indicated by `${process.env.documenturl}`) for document generation and processing.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/utils/letter.js` file underwent several revisions between 09:16:56 and 09:58:25 on October 9, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was the `generateLetterPreview` asynchronous function and the `stringifyLetterFields` function.

Initially,  `generateLetterPreview`  was heavily commented out.  The uncommenting and modification of this function comprised a substantial portion of the updates.  Significant changes included:

* **Improved Logging:**  Extensive `console.log` statements were added throughout `generateLetterPreview` to log `company_details`, the `replaceImage` array, the payload sent to the API, and the API response. This was clearly added for debugging purposes.

* **Conditional Image Inclusion:** Images (logo, official stamp, signatures) are now only included in the generated letter preview if the `letterTemplate.status` is "completed" or "approved".  Before this change, images were always included.  An `officialStampUrl` variable was introduced to extract official stamp URLs from company documents.

* **`stringifyLetterFields` Modification:** The `stringifyLetterFields` function was significantly altered.  Initially a simple stringify function, it evolved to accept a new `imageKeysToExclude` parameter. This parameter allows the exclusion of specific image placeholders (like "[logo]") from the `replaceText` data sent to the API. The changes improved the efficiency of text replacement by excluding image keys.  The function now correctly handles flat and nested objects within the `request.letterFields` object.

* **Refactoring:** A large commented-out version of `generateLetterPreview` was removed  at some point. Additionally the nested object handling in `replaceLetterFields` was improved.


The changes in `/response_777e85bf-9dac-4689-8a6d-b39b066d0c65/0` and `/response_777e85bf-9dac-4689-8a6d-b39b066d0c65/1` directly reflect the improvements made in `generateLetterPreview` and `stringifyLetterFields` within `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/utils/letter.js`.  These files seem to be temporary or intermediate files used during the development process.  The changes made in these files closely mirror those in the main `letter.js` file showing a clear evolution of the code towards a more robust and debuggable version.
