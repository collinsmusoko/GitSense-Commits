# Activity Summary for 02/09/2025

## 11:50:45
The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/letterTemplates/Editor/LetterTemplate.vue` file was updated on 02/09/2025, 11:11:09.  This update involved a significant revision of the component's code.  The changes primarily focus on creating a Vue.js component for editing letter templates.  The component uses a stepper to guide the user through different sections: Template Details, Content Editor.

The "Template Details" section allows users to input template name, description, category selection (using a multi-select autocomplete), date/number format selection, currency symbol placement, and request options (hard copy, team calendar visibility). It also includes a section for managing "Letter Fields" which allows adding and removing fields via a dialog, utilizing a search component for filtering available fields.   Request limits are configurable, including setting a period, maximum number of requests and specifying the action when the limit is exceeded.  All input fields extensively utilize Vuetify components (v-text-field, v-autocomplete, v-switch, etc.) for styling and validation.

The "Content Editor" section appears to integrate a `WordEditor` component (presumably a rich text editor), allowing users to create and modify the actual content of the letter template.

The component uses several reusable components, including a search component and a "no data" component.  The code incorporates various features such as validation rules (`genericRule`, `minZeroRules`),  icon usage, and conditional rendering based on user input (e.g., displaying request limit options only when enabled). The overall structure suggests a well-organized and feature-rich form for managing letter templates within a larger HRMS application.

The log shows two revisions of `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/reuseable/letter/index.vue`, a Vue.js component for managing letter requests.  The key difference between the revisions (at 12:25:28 and 12:44:47 on 02/09/2025) lies in the change of the `<v-autocomplete>` component to a `<v-combobox>` component within the form.  The rest of the component's code, including the handling of letter fields, date pickers, form submission (`handleSubmit` method), data handling, and computed properties remains unchanged.  The component uses Vuetify (`v-form`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-combobox`, `v-date-picker`, `v-btn`),  Syncfusion's DocumentEditorPlugin, and Axios for API calls.  The component fetches letter templates based on a module page and filters them based on active status and category.  It dynamically generates form fields based on the selected letter type. Error handling and notification mechanisms are implemented using Vuex and Nuxt.js.
