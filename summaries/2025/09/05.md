# Activity Summary for 05/09/2025

## 10:01:46
The log shows multiple updates to three files within the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin` project on May 9th, 2025.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/utils/letter.js` underwent several revisions between 09:26:33 and 09:53:21.  The core functionality,  functions for generating letter previews (`generateLetterPreview`), remains consistent.  The changes primarily focus on the `stringifyLetterFields` function.  Early versions lacked robust handling of different input formats for `request.letterFields` (array vs. object). Later versions include added logging statements for debugging and improved handling of both array and object types of `request.letterFields`, making the function more resilient to variations in input data.

`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/hr-self-service/requests.vue` was updated at 09:45:20 and again at 09:52:03.  These updates appear to be minor and likely involve UI/UX refinements or bug fixes, as the core structure of the component handling different request types (leave, loan, etc.)  remains the same. No significant functional changes are evident from the diff. The second update at 09:52:03 seems to be an insignificant change within the file.


`/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/reuseable/letter/index.vue` was modified at 09:51:51. This update introduces a Vue component for creating new letter requests. It includes a form with a combobox for selecting letter types, text fields for additional letter information, and a date picker for date fields.  The component handles date field detection and validation, using a `handleSubmit` function to send the new request to the `/letter/request/new/v2` endpoint.  The component also uses Syncfusion's DocumentEditorPlugin (a commercial component, license key included in the code).  This suggests the addition of a reusable letter request component to the application.
