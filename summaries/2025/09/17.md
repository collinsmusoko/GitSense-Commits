## 11:55:13
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin` project, specifically focusing on the `documents` configuration component.  Multiple revisions occurred between 09:25 and 11:28 on September 17th, 2025.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` file underwent several iterations.  Changes primarily involved refining the user interface for managing document types, including basic details and settings.  A significant addition was an email template editor dialog, allowing for the creation and modification of email templates for document expiry reminders.  The repeated timestamps suggest iterative improvements to the email template functionality and minor UI adjustments.  The log shows improvements in logging with more descriptive messages like adding `ðŸ”„` before `Loading email templates from`.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` file was also updated concurrently with `fields.vue`. These changes focused on enhancing the main document configuration interface, adding features like search, filtering (by "Company Documents" and "Employee Documents"), and sorting. The component interacts with  `fields.vue` to display and edit document details. The multiple updates to this file within a short timeframe indicate bug fixes, UI improvements or feature additions related to data display and user interaction.


The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` file contains the backend logic for handling document configurations.  It includes functions for creating, retrieving, and updating document configurations, with a notable feature for sending expiry reminder notifications.  The `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function sends both real-time notifications and emails using templates,  handling both user and manager notifications. This file was updated only once, at 11:26:24, showing a substantial update to the notification and email sending process. The added logging is more descriptive.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/email_template.service.js` file manages email templates.  It provides functions for creating, listing, updating, and deleting email templates. It includes logic to populate email templates with data from related modules in the application. The file underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on improvements to data retrieval and template population functions. The main updates appear to handle replacing placeholders in email templates with actual data and also handling emails to and cc fields correctly. There were multiple minor updates to this file suggesting bug fixes and performance optimizations.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` on September 17, 2025.  The changes are minor and clustered within a short time frame (12:40:17 to 12:48:33).  The file is a Vue.js component dealing with document configurations, specifically focusing on document types, settings (including expiry reminders and email templates), and supported file types.

No substantive code changes are apparent across the revisions; the differences seem insignificant, possibly related to minor formatting adjustments or whitespace changes within the already existing code, rather than functional updates. The component uses Vuetify for UI elements.  There's a significant section dedicated to managing email templates for document expiry reminders, including functionality for creating, editing, loading, and deleting templates.  The templates utilize placeholders to personalize the email content.  The component also handles image uploads and previews based on supported file types and aspect ratios.


## 14:55:06
The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` file was updated on 17/09/2025 at 14:54:59.  The changes involve a Vue.js component for managing document configurations.  The component uses tabs ("Basic Details" and "Settings") to organize the form fields.

**Basic Details Tab:**  This section allows for defining document type, applicable users (All, Company, Employee), categories (using a multi-select autocomplete), and a description.

**Settings Tab:** This section handles document settings including required status, expiry settings (with expiry reminders), supported file types (Images or Documents), maximum file size, and image ratio (only if "Images" is selected).  Expiry reminders are configured using a dynamic list where users can add, edit, and remove reminders specifying days before expiry and selecting email templates.  There's an integrated email template editor (a modal dialog) enabling the creation and editing of email templates for expiry reminders.  These templates use placeholders for dynamic content insertion.  The template editor allows for previewing the subject and content using sample data.

**Email Template Management:** The component includes functionality to load, create, and edit email templates. The `loadEmailTemplates` method fetches templates (the log is truncated, but the comment suggests it fetches from `/email_template/get/all`). The component maintains a list of available placeholders for use in the templates.

The overall update significantly enhances the document configuration section by adding features for managing document expiry reminders and associated email templates, providing a more comprehensive and user-friendly interface.
