The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/fields.vue` file underwent several iterations.  Changes primarily involved refining the user interface for managing document types, including basic details and settings.  A significant addition was an email template editor dialog, allowing for the creation and modification of email templates for document expiry reminders.  The repeated timestamps suggest iterative improvements to the email template functionality and minor UI adjustments.  The log shows improvements in logging with more descriptive messages like adding `ðŸ”„` before `Loading email templates from`.

The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-admin/components/configurations/documents/index.vue` file was also updated concurrently with `fields.vue`. These changes focused on enhancing the main document configuration interface, adding features like search, filtering (by "Company Documents" and "Employee Documents"), and sorting. The component interacts with  `fields.vue` to display and edit document details. The multiple updates to this file within a short timeframe indicate bug fixes, UI improvements or feature additions related to data display and user interaction.


The `/Users/collin/projects/hrms/hrdirect-mcs-api/src/services/documentConfig.service.js` file contains the backend logic for handling document configurations.

The `sendDocumentExpiryNotifications` function sends both real-time notifications and emails using templates,  handling both user and manager notifications. This file was updated only once, at 11:26:24, showing a substantial update to the notification and email sending process. The added logging is more descriptive.

There were multiple minor updates to this file suggesting bug fixes and performance optimizations.
